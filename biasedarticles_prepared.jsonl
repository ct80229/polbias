{"prompt":"As my colleagues and I hiked through the Nelder giant sequoia grove south of Yosemite National Park recently, we could barely believe our eyes. In 2017, the Railroad fire swept through nearly all of the Nelder Grove, burning lightly in most areas but very intensely in the portion where we walked, about six years after the fire. The naturally regenerating giant sequoia forest was so vigorous and lush that, in many places, we had to pull the stems of young sequoias apart just so we could walk between them. There were hundreds of them on almost every acre — many of them already 8 or 9 feet tall. It was a remarkable sight because, in that particular location, the Railroad fire burned hot, killing trees, including about three dozen mature sequoias. This high-intensity fire patch is isolated; it’s nearly half a mile from the grove’s nearest remaining live, mature sequoias. How was the extraordinary rejuvenation of giant sequoias possible there? The U.S. Forest Service, which manages the Nelder Grove and many other sequoia groves, has repeatedly told the public, the media and Congress that giant sequoias are adapted to mild and moderate surface fires. The agency has insisted that emergency actions in sequoia groves are necessary to save the trees from high-intensity fire and ensure that only lower-intensity fire occurs. Those emergency actions could take the form of bulldozers, chain saws and logging, without benefit of the usual environmental safeguards, if pending legislation — the deceptively named Save Our Sequoias Act, introduced by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) — passes in Congress. Meanwhile, the Forest Service is already moving forward with logging plans in the Nelder Grove, based on this “emergency” posture. But the evidence on the ground in the Nelder Grove and other burn areas contradicts the narrative that lower-intensity fire is the only good fire. Is it possible that we’ve got it all wrong when it comes to giant sequoias and wildfires? As it happens, some of the U.S. Forest Service’s own scientific studies already explored that question years ago, indicating that mixed-intensity fire, not logging, is the solution for giant sequoias. However, for an agency that is still focused on selling public trees to private logging companies and keeping the revenue for its budget, that can be an inconvenient answer. In 1994, for example, the Forest Service issued a study finding that the agency’s successful elimination of wildfires for more than a century was actually killing the sequoia groves and threatening their survival. The old “monarch” sequoias were slowly dying off, and new sequoia seedlings and saplings were almost completely absent, resulting in a “massive failure of sequoia reproduction.” The study found that, in order to maintain stable or increasing populations, giant sequoias depend specifically on high-intensity fire in patches, noting that the “giant sequoia is what is known as a ‘pioneer species,’ requiring canopy-destroying disturbance to complete its life cycle.” These pockets of intense wildfire melt the resins in sequoia cones, allowing them to release seeds by the tens of thousands, while also creating more sunlight for the seedlings and consuming the thick layer of twigs and needles on the forest floor, turning it into a nutrient-rich bed of ash that helps young sequoias grow and thrive. Twelve years ago, another Forest Service study found a distinct lack of sequoia reproduction in low-intensity fire areas and a high density of reproduction in high-intensity fire patches. Managing for homogenous low-intensity fire, and attempting to prevent and exclude higher-intensity fire, is like managing for the extinction of giant sequoias. When the Washburn fire burned part of the famed Mariposa sequoia grove in Yosemite last year, it burned at low intensity where the park had previously conducted prescribed burns. Park officials claimed success, based on the assumption that reducing fire intensity is categorically a good thing for giant sequoias. But the science has been telling us a more complex story for decades. Of course, sequoias can’t tolerate high-intensity fire either. We want a mix of low, moderate and high, and that is what we have been getting in the Sierra. Despite reports of utter decimation by high-intensity fire, my research, based on recent satellite imagery and ground surveys, indicates that the big 2020-through-2021 wildfires have killed about 8% of the sequoias, not up to 20%, as some have claimed. A loss of 8% sounds bad in itself, but it may be in line with what could have occurred naturally before 20th century fire exclusion. And as in the Nelder Grove, where some patches of mature giant sequoia are torched by high-intensity fires, there will likely be hundreds of saplings for every one killed. If we truly care about giant sequoia forests, the path forward should not involve mandated emergency powers that circumvent environmental laws and public participation, powers that could unleash potentially destructive logging. The Save Our Sequoias Act is wrong-headed, which is why it is strongly opposed by more than 80 environmental organizations. No, to have healthy, vibrant giant sequoia forests in the future, we need some humility and some respect for a species that has evolved an interdependent relationship with mixed-intensity wildfires over the course of 90 million years. Above all, we will need to begin to appreciate and accept the dynamic forces of wild nature, like wildfires, that may seem alarming to us, but which also shape and nurture giant sequoia forests and many other fire-adapted ecosystems on the planet. We must learn to see the beauty in the burn. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 1, Summary: The text argues against the Save Our Sequoias Act, introduced by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) and claims that the U.S. Forest Service's insistence on emergency actions in sequoia groves are unnecessary.

{"prompt":"Cutting oil and gas production would be 'dangerous and irresponsible', the boss of energy giant Shell has told the BBC. Wael Sawan insisted that the world still 'desperately needs oil and gas' as moves to renewable energy were not happening fast enough to replace it. He warned increased demand from China and a cold winter in Europe could push energy prices and bills higher again. Mr Sawan angered climate scientists who said Shell's plan to continue current oil production until 2030 was wrong. Professor Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist at the University of Cambridge, said firms such as Shell should focus on accelerating the green transition 'rather than trying to suggest the most vulnerable in society are in any way best served by prolonging our use of oil and gas'. Mr Sawan told the BBC: 'I respectfully disagree.' He added: 'What would be dangerous and irresponsible is cutting oil and gas production so that the cost of living, as we saw last year, starts to shoot up again.' The world is in a race to ditch fossil fuels in favour of greener alternatives as globally leaders have pledged to keep the world from warming by more than 1.5C this century. Last year the European Commission outlined how the EU would speed up its shift to green energy to end its dependency on Russian oil and gas. Many countries do not have the infrastructure to move to more sustainable forms of energy. Mr Sawan said an international bidding war for gas last year saw poorer countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh unable to afford Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) shipments that were instead diverted to Northern Europe. 'They took away LNG from those countries and children had to work and study by candlelight,' he said. 'If we're going to have a transition it needs to be a just transition that doesn't just work for one part of the world.' The Committee of Climate Change found household gas appliances were linked to respiratory problems and cardiovascular disease. Claire Fyson, co-head of climate policy at Climate Analytics, a global science and policy institute, told the BBC: 'The idea that it's a choice between our addiction to fossil fuels or working by candlelight is a gross misrepresentation of reality, when we know renewables are cleaner, cheaper and better for public health.' The UK has pledged to spend £11.6bn on international climate finance but a memo seen by the BBC said economic shocks like the Covid pandemic had'turned a stretching target into a huge challenge'. The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, has said that 'if governments are serious about the climate crisis, there can be no new investments in oil, gas and coal from now'. While head of the UN Antonio Gutteres said investment in new oil and gas production was 'economic and moral madness'. 'Lack of stability' Shell has a long history and a headquarters in the UK. But Mr Sawan said a lack of clarity and stability on energy policy and taxation risked making the UK a less attractive place to invest compared with more welcoming countries. The UK has increased tax on UK-derived profits from 40 to 75% until 2028 unless oil and gas prices fall below thresholds for a sustained period - which most energy experts doubt will happen. The UK currently imports more than half of its oil and gas - and that proportion is expected to rise without renewed investment in the North Sea. Shell recently decided to sell its stake in a major new undeveloped oil field at Cambo. Ultimately the government needs to make a call as to their views on imported versus domestic production, said Mr Sawan. 'When you do not have the stability you require in these long-term investments, that raises questions when we compare that to other countries where there is very clear support for those investments.'' 'Energy we desperately need' Mr Sawan was also keen to stress the warm welcome extended to the company by the New York Stock Exchange at a recent investors' meeting where they laid out their plans to cut costs and maximise profits. 'The welcome we had there was exemplary. The Shell flag was waving next to the New York Stock Exchange flag,' he said. He said that the officials there had underlined his feeling that the US was more supportive of oil and gas companies. 'They said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need. That resonated with me as a person who comes from Lebanon where we are starved of energy.' Future move to US Mr Sarwan did not rule out moving Shell's headquarters and stock market listing to the US. American oil companies command higher prices for their shares - Exxon Mobil for example is worth 40% more than Shell per dollar of profit. 'There are many who question whether that valuation gap can only be bridged if we move to the US. A move of headquarters is not a priority for the next three years. But after that? I would never rule out anything that could potentially create the right circumstances for the company and its shareholders. Ultimately, I am in the service of shareholder value,' he said. Although Shell says it has no plans to move its headquarters or stock market listing from London to New York for the next three years, Mr Sawan's comments will add to fears that London's stock market is losing its lustre as a venue for multinational companies to raise money after technology darling ARM Holdings recently announced plans to move its primary listing to the US. A move of the UK's most valuable UK company to the US would seriously dent the UK's financial prestige and cost jobs in the financial services sector. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 1, Summary: The CEO of Shell defends oil and gas production, stating that cutting production would be dangerous and irresponsible.

{"prompt":"July 5 (Reuters) - Law schools that give preferences to minorities and women in admissions and hiring risk getting sued by America First Legal, the conservative legal group warned in a letter to 200 U.S. law schools following last week's U.S. Supreme Court decision on affirmative action. America First Legal, a nonprofit group headed by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, said on its website that it sent the letter threatening to sue the law schools if they extend any “discriminatory preferences” based on race, gender or national origin. The group also said decisions based on factors in an applicant's biography that could serve as a proxy for race—such as socioeconomic status—is also unlawful. The letter, dated June 30 and reviewed by Reuters, came one day after the U.S. Supreme Court held that giving some minority college applicants a boost over others based on their race violated the U.S. Constitution. “You must immediately announce the termination of all forms of race, national origin, and sex preferences in student admissions, faculty hiring, and law review membership or article selection,” the letter said, adding that law schools “must” announce policies prohibiting preferential treatment before the start of the school year.Erwin Chemerinsky, dean at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said on Wednesday that America First Legal’s letter, which his school received, adopts an expansive view of the Supreme Court’s recent decision. That ruling deals only with college admissions, he said. The use of proxies for racial diversity, such as an applicant’s family income, will likely be sorted out in the coming years through litigation, Chemerinsky said. “I read the America First message as their trying to pressure law schools to read the decision very broadly and to curtail efforts to pursue diversity in all areas,” Chemerinsky said. In addition to admissions and hiring, the letter also claims that racial and gender preferences in law journal participation and article selection violates the law. America First Legal, founded in 2021, describes itself in the letter to law schools as a civil rights organization that provides free legal representation to victims of unlawful discrimination. Law schools must advise their admissions departments that they could potentially face personal liability for engaging in race-based decision-making, and should do what they should have done all along and adopt absolutely race-neutral admissions practices, said America First General Counsel Gene Hamilton on Wednesday. Law deans at Harvard and the University of North Carolina—the two institutions at the center of the affirmative action challenges at the Supreme Court—did not respond or declined to comment on America First Legal’s letters. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 1, Summary: America First Legal, a conservative legal group led by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has sent letters to 200 U.S. law schools warning of potential lawsuits if they continue to use affirmative action policies that give preferences to minorities and women.

{"prompt":"In those cases, the conservative justices were unified in the majority and the liberal justices dissented. 'The term will be most remembered for the decisions of the last couple of days that moved the law in a dramatically conservative direction,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Berkeley Law School, referring to the affirmative action, web designer and student loans rulings. 'All were 6-3 and again show the impact of President Trump's three picks for the court,' Chemerinsky added. The court on May 25 also put another dent in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory reach, embracing a stringent new test for declaring wetlands protected under a landmark federal anti-pollution law. In that case, the liberal justices were joined by one conservative justice, Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh, in dissenting on the new test. SOME VICTORIES FOR THE LIBERALS Chemerinsky cited some victories for the liberals during the term. These included the court finding that Alabama violated a federal law against discrimination in voting, throwing out a challenge to federal preferences for Native Americans and tribal members in the adoption or foster care placements of Native American children, dismissing a challenge by Texas to Biden immigration policy and rejecting a legal theory that stood to hand virtually unchecked power to state legislatures to establish rules concerning federal elections. A key moment for the court - letting its conservative majority further exert its clout - came when Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's third appointee, was confirmed by the Senate in 2020, replacing the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The court on consecutive days in June 2022 expanded gun rights and overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide. Still, with the addition of Jackson, there were fewer rulings in which the conservatives were on one side and the liberals were on the other this term compared to last - five versus 14. 'This shows the court with the addition of Justice Jackson moved away a bit from ideological split decisions this term, although the court split ideologically in some of its most important decisions,'' said Adam Feldman, a legal scholar who tracks court data on his blog Empirical SCOTUS. The court has several important cases in their coming term. The justices on Friday agreed to decide whether a 1994 federal law that bars people under domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms violates the Constitution's Second Amendment. The justices will hear an appeal by Biden's administration of a lower court's ruling that found that the law ran afoul of the Second Amendment's 'right to keep and bear arms' because it fell outside 'our nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.' The case involves a Texas man charged with illegal gun possession while subject to a domestic violence restraining order after assaulting his girlfriend. The court also has taken up a case involving commercial fishermen that could further undercut the regulatory power of federal agencies, as well as a constitutional challenge to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding structure. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 1, Summary: The U.S. Supreme Court's recent term, dominated by its conservative majority, is highlighted in this article.

{"prompt":"Law firm Consovoy McCarthy achieved a long-sought victory on Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to strike down race-based college admissions policies. But the firm’s co-founder, Thomas McCarthy, told reporters afterward that the occasion was “bittersweet.” William Consovoy, the firm's other founder and a prominent conservative lawyer who once led the lawsuit challenging affirmative action at Harvard University, died in January at age 48.'It was his brilliant vision, his skillful strategy, and his boundless energy that led the way,' McCarthy told Reuters. Consovoy McCarthy represented Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, in the successful challenges to race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. “Every time we got together and shook hands or hugged, we always recognized there was only one thing wrong with this picture,” Blum said, describing the aftermath of the decision. “Will Consovoy wasn’t here.” The law firm notched another partial victory on Friday, when the Supreme Court blocked President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $430 billion in student loan debt. Consovoy McCarthy lawyers represented two college graduates ineligible for the full student debt relief in one of two cases that challenged Biden’s executive order. The Supreme Court concluded that the graduates did not suffer harm that would allow them to sue over the plan, but it ruled in favor of a related challenge from Republican-led states that sought to block the order. The affirmative action and student loan decisions -- each delivered by the high court's 6-3 conservative majority -- underscored both the court's rightward shift and Consovoy McCarthy's position as a central player in the contemporary conservative legal movement. The decade-old, Arlington, Virginia-based firm now has more than 20 lawyers. It has represented the Republican National Committee and several Republican officials. It also spearheaded lawsuits for former President Donald Trump over his financial records. Affirmative action had long been a target of Consovoy's. Students for Fair Admissions was the firm’s first client when he and McCarthy left prominent Washington firm Wiley Rein to start their own practice in 2014. Blum likened the firm in its early days to a 'two-man garage band.' The small law firm piloted both affirmative action lawsuits against Harvard and UNC that landed before the Supreme Court. Before his death, Consovoy personally argued before the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in the Harvard case. Consovoy, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, was set to do the same at the Supreme Court last year but pulled out after falling ill with brain cancer. Two other partners at the firm, Cameron Norris and Patrick Strawbridge, handled oral arguments. The attorneys argued that considering race in college admissions decisions discriminated against white and Asian American students and violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. Proponents of the policy said it created educational opportunities for Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented minorities and broadened the range of perspectives on American campuses. Even before the rulings this week, Consovoy McCarthy had teed up other legal battles. The state of Tennessee recently hired the firm to help defend its law banning transition care for transgender minors. It also has ongoing cases challenging a fellowship program aimed at boosting diversity at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and targeting Google for allegedly sending emails from the Republican National Committee to users' spam folders. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 1, Summary: Law firm Consovoy McCarthy, founded by William Consovoy and Thomas McCarthy, achieved a victory as the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-based college admissions policies.The firm, representing Students for Fair Admissions, has been involved in lawsuits against affirmative action and successfully blocked President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.

{"prompt":"President Biden is off to repeating – once again – what has been labeled a 'highly misleading' claim about the federal budget deficit.

{"prompt":"As elections approach, sweeping generalizations have a certain allure that often energizes the frustrated and captivates the hopeful. However, it's essential that we as voters remember that things that seem too good to be true typically are. Here are a few warnings. First, as far as our finances go, beware of politicians promising that they won't touch Social Security and Medicare. In reality, they'll have no choice. For one thing, if they keep this hollow promise, Social Security benefits will be cut across the board in 2033 by over 20 percent. According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, that's a cut of between $12,000 and $17,000 annually for a traditional retired couple. Medicare faces the same predicament for a variety of reasons. The only workaround from this reality, which has been known for decades, is for Democrats and Republicans to finally come together for serious reform. That will likely result in a reduction of benefits and an increase in taxes. As unpleasant as it will be, we'd better hope that politicians don't take the cowardly path and resort to shoving the problem onto Uncle Sam's proverbial credit card (by paying all benefits that exceed payroll-tax receipts out of general revenues). As the Manhattan Institute's Brian Riedl noted recently, 'Social Security and Medicare are projected by the CBO to spend $156 trillion in benefits but collect only $87 trillion in payroll taxes and premiums. This $69 trillion cash shortfall will have to be financed by budget deficits, which will in turn be responsible for $47 trillion of interest costs on the national debt.' Who will lend the U.S. government $114 trillion, even at unprecedentedly high interest rates? That's a question voters should ask politicians who promise never to touch entitlement programs. Those who claim it's an easy fix by taxing the rich should be immediately dismissed as unserious. The numbers don't add up. Any other one-sided ideological answers to an accounting question won't cut it, either. Politicians are also masters of making complex societal problems appear as if they can be solved easily with a single piece of legislation. For instance, voters should beware of politicians promising to improve social media and online retailing by hammering Big Tech with antitrust lawsuits, as if these companies represent true monopolies. Google, Amazon, and today's other large tech firms grew so successfully only because consumers chose to buy their services, and they will remain successful and large only as long as consumers continue to do so. Every allegedly 'dominant' tech firm has competitors just waiting for it to get lazy or fail. In such a fast-changing industry, these competitors will swoop in and quickly take market share. Or a firm that makes too many mistakes will be bought out by investors who aim to improve its performance. Think here of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter. To use antitrust against successful firms is to obstruct the operation of very complex patterns of commercial organization that no politician or government lawyer can hope to understand. The kind of antitrust interventions now demanded by populists on the left and right would be like angry bulls in a china shop. They'll be able to destroy, but all that they'll create is rubble. Finally, be careful as politicians skillfully play the populist card, painting a picture of 'us' against 'them' and tapping into deep-seated fears and frustrations. For instance, beware of the claim that many economic problems stem from foreign competition and can easily be solved by applying a blanket 10 percent tariff across all imports. These tariffs are supposed to encourage firms to source their inputs domestically and to incentivize consumers to buy American. That won't work, as we should know by now after the Trump\/Biden protectionist fiascos. Because tariffs raise prices, they reduce the purchasing power not only of American consumers, but also of American producers who need inputs. What follows are a series of adjustments making everyone worse off without addressing the problem at hand. For instance, protecting American sugar with tariffs and quotas results in more imports of candy. Protecting aluminum with tariffs results in more imported garbage disposals and other products made with aluminum. Politicians' messages offer a simplified view of the world—one in which government interventions are all benefits and no costs. But life, as we know, is anything but simple, and Uncle Sam's intervention can be quite destructive. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to demand from our politicians more than charismatic speeches and lofty promises. We must demand clear, implementable, and serious policy proposals along with the acknowledgement of trade-offs. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 2, Summary: As elections approach, voters are cautioned against falling for sweeping generalizations and unrealistic promises made by politicians.

{"prompt":"A position at REI was the first and only retail job Claire Chang says she ever considered taking. A shopping mecca for outdoor enthusiasts, the retailer had cultivated a progressive reputation: promoting sustainability, famously closing on Black Friday to encourage people to play outside, giving workers a paid four-week sabbatical after 15 years and running as a co-op co-owned by its shoppers. 'I mean, we all started working at REI because of its values,' says Chang, a visual presentation specialist who has been at the flagship store in New York's SoHo neighborhood for five years. Now, she and hundreds of other REI workers find themselves at odds with their employer over their efforts to unionize. After health and safety worries during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by furloughs and job cuts, Chang's team in SoHo became REI's first union shop in March 2022, in a landslide vote of 88 to 14. 'Despite being a large corporation, we had hopes that REI would be a different type of company, like they say they are,' Chang says. 'So we were hopeful that they would voluntarily recognize the union and, you know, meet us at the table and negotiate in good faith.' REI did not voluntarily recognize the union. Since the SoHo store's vote, seven more stores across the U.S. have unionized; a ninth vote remains too close to call. Pro-union workers have formally accused the company of breaking labor laws — threatening and intimidating workers, disciplining and firing organizers — which REI denies. More than a year into it, workers and the company are nowhere close to a collective bargaining contract.Workers push for steady hours and financial stability REI leaders argue that negotiating with a union would hinder the company's ability to 'resolve concerns at the speed the world is moving,' as CEO Eric Artz said on a corporate podcast recorded last year before the first union victory. REI did not make Artz available for an interview but sent NPR a statement instead. 'We respect our employees' rights under the law, including the right to choose whether to be represented by a union,' it said. 'However, we do not feel a union is necessary for our employees, who enjoy industry-leading wages and benefits, along with multiple outlets through which to provide input to co-op leadership.'REI says it has more than 16,000 employees in 181 stores. In addition to New York, workers have unionized in Berkeley, Calif., Cleveland, Chicago, Boston, Durham, N.C., Maple Grove, Minn., and Bellingham, Wash. They've joined the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union or its affiliate, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.We would like essentially a living wage and good hours,' says Jezzi Reynolds, who has been a sales associate in the Bellingham store for just over a year. REI often pays above $15 an hour; shortly after the first union win in SoHo, the chain raised wages nationwide, adding around $1 to $3 per hour for many. But workers say soon a lot of them saw their assigned hours cut. They describe schedules so inconsistent that a part-timer might get 14 hours one week, then 24 hours the next and four the following. Reynolds and fellow pro-union workers advocate for guaranteed minimum hours and financial stability. Other organizers also mention higher pay as well as grievance and arbitration procedures. 'It got to the point where the workers said, 'You know what — we're going to practice your values for you because you're not living up to them,'' Dave Hein, who works at the Cleveland REI bike shop, said at a news conference in June. 'And that is what we're going to put in a contract.'A version of this has played out at other companies that have spent decades building a progressive image as a generous employer. At Trader Joe's, workers have clashed over the pluses and minuses of a union. At Starbucks, the chain's anti-union fight is now a prominent plotline in its American story. The idea that a firm that purports to be progressive and sustainable plays hardball with its workers on economic issues, when it's actually doing pretty well, I think it makes it hard to keep that message,' says Denise Rousseau, professor of organizational behavior at Carnegie Mellon University. For 2022, REI reported record sales of $3.9 billion, though overall it registered a loss, in part because of what the CEO called 'the largest single-year investment' in employee pay and bonuses. Raises given, then rescinded at unionized store When REI bumped up pay nationwide last year, it did so with one exception: the SoHo store, which was the only unionized shop at the time. The company, in its statement, argued that workers, by unionizing, chose to have 'all aspects of their pay ... be negotiated at the bargaining table.' The union and the retailer struck a temporary deal: REI would give SoHo workers pay raises. The union would promise not to strike, among other things. The idea was to propel negotiations. REI, in fact, stood out among retailers with similar labor clashes for just how quickly it and the union began discussing a collective bargaining deal — unlike Starbucks or Amazon, for example, which contested the very results and proceedings of their union elections. But over months, negotiations at REI stalled. The union accuses the company of delays — striking out proposals without countering, dragging its feet on producing requested documents. A few bargaining sessions were canceled after REI changed law firms, hiring one that labor advocates view as a more aggressive union buster. 'The collective bargaining process is a lengthy legal one, and the timeline of our negotiations in SoHo and Berkeley is not atypical,' REI representatives wrote to NPR, saying the retailer was 'engaged in good-faith bargaining' and 'will continue to participate fully in the negotiating process.' In June, the union's temporary deal with the company expired. SoHo workers refused to renew it, reclaiming their right to strike. REI then rescinded their raises, reducing their pay.'It hit a lot of people pretty hard,' Chang says of the pay cuts for her SoHo team. 'You know, I am pretty much living paycheck to paycheck — a lot of my co-workers are.' The National Labor Relations Board is reviewing more than two dozen claims of unfair labor practices against REI, including claims about its handling of the wage increases and union-contract negotiations. The company says the claims are without merit. 'It is disappointing, you know, that REI has reacted in this manner and continues to double down,' Chang says. 'The truth is, people really enjoy working at REI. So we want to stay and make it better.' ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 2, Summary: Workers at outdoor retailer REI are in conflict with the company over their efforts to unionize. After health and safety concerns during the pandemic, followed by furloughs and job cuts, several REI stores across the U.S. have unionized, with workers accusing the company of breaking labor laws. REI argues that a union would hinder its ability to address concerns quickly and states that its employees already enjoy industry-leading wages and benefits. Workers pushing for unionization seek steady hours, financial stability, higher pay, and grievance procedures. Negotiations between the union and the company have stalled, and the union accuses REI of delays and changing law firms, while REI claims to be engaged in good-faith bargaining. The article presents a neutral perspective, although it is slightly pro-union. It highlights the conflict between workers and the company, with an emphasis on the workers' desire to improve their working conditions through union representation.\n"}
{"prompt":"The FDA on Thursday granted traditional approval to an Alzheimer’s drug for the first time in more than two decades. Now, the question becomes how many people will be able to access the drug, which is targeted at patients in the early stages of the debilitating disease. Medicare has said that it will reimburse the drug’s costs — more than $26,000 annually — only for beneficiaries enrolled in a nationwide registry that tracks patient side effects and outcomes over time. Patient advocacy groups and some clinicians fear this means that few of the hundreds of thousands of Alzheimer’s patients eligible for the treatment will be able to access it. 'People living with this fatal disease deserve the opportunity to discuss and choose, with their doctor and family, whether an FDA-approved treatment is right for them,' Joanne Pike, CEO of patient advocacy group the Alzheimer’s Association, said in a statement. Access to the drug is one of the association’s top priorities, she added. The group previously asked CMS to broaden its coverage of the drug, but the agency denied this request. The agency previously granted Leqembi, developed and manufactured by Eisai and Biogen, accelerated approval before evaluating late-stage clinical trial data earlier this year. The drug moderately slowed trial participants’ cognitive decline compared to a placebo, according to the data, but had potentially serious side effects, including brain swelling and bleeding. Under accelerated approval, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would cover Leqembi only for those participating in a randomized clinical trial, of which none were enrolling. Medicare’s coverage determination was contrary to the Veterans Health Administration, which said it would cover the drug for its beneficiaries without restriction. Roughly 6.7 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer’s, and there are few treatments for the disease. Aduhelm, a drug from Biogen that received accelerated approval in 2021, works similarly to Leqembi by targeting proteins thought to be one of the causes of the disease. But both drugs have received little uptake due to Medicare coverage restrictions, and patient and caregiver concerns over the evidence of its modest benefits. There are five existing treatments for Alzheimer’s that treat some of the disease’s symptoms, but do not slow progression of the disease. 'Today’s action is the first verification that a drug targeting the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s disease has shown clinical benefit,' Teresa Buracchio, acting director of the Office of Neuroscience in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. 'This confirmatory study verified that it is a safe and effective treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.' Lawmakers and advocacy groups have pressed CMS to reduce or eliminate coverage restrictions for Leqembi and drugs like it to ensure maximum patient uptake. In June, CMS said it would make a national patient registry available on its website and that it would ask physicians only for basic information about patients’ they typically collect — such as whether the patient is taking certain drugs that could increase the risk of side effects and how a patient’s cognition progresses over time. 'With FDA’s decision, CMS will cover this medication broadly while continuing to gather data that will help us understand how the drug works,' CMS administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a statement. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 2, Summary: The FDA has granted traditional approval to an Alzheimer's drug called Leqembi, developed by Eisai and Biogen.

{"prompt":"Human Rights Watch has called on Russia and Ukraine to stop using cluster bombs, and urged the US not to supply the munitions to Kyiv, amid reports the Biden administration is poised to include the controversial weapons in a new military aid package. Russian and Ukraine forces have used cluster bombs, which break apart in the air and release large numbers of smaller bomblets across a wide area.The bomblets are designed to detonate on hitting the ground, but do not always explode, posing a risk to civilians for years afterwards. The weapons, first used in the second world war, were banned by more than 120 nations under the Convention on Cluster Munitions in 2008. Russia, Ukraine and the US have all declined to sign the treaty. Kyiv has urged members of the US Congress to press the White House to approve sending over cluster bombs. US officials say cluster bombs would be effective for Ukraine against Russian forces in strong defensive positions. The White House said on Thursday that providing cluster munitions to Ukraine is under 'active consideration', and US officials told Reuters that the administration is expected to announce the new weapons aid package that will include these weapons on Friday. Ukrainian and Russian forces have used cluster munitions that caused numerous civilian deaths and serious injuries, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Thursday, calling on both sides to immediately stop using the 'inherently indiscriminate' weapons. US officials have claimed that any munitions provided to Ukraine would have a reduced 'dud rate', meaning there will be far fewer unexploded rounds that could later result in unintended civilian deaths.Ukraine fired cluster munition rockets into Russian-controlled areas in and near the eastern Ukrainian city of Izium last year, causing many casualties among Ukrainian civilians, the rights group said, citing interviews with more than 100 residents, witnesses and local emergency personnel. The Ukrainian attacks killed at least eight civilians and wounded at least 15 civilians in Izium, it said. The group has previously reported that Russia’s use of cluster bombs in Ukraine resulted in the deaths of scores of civilians, and the United Nations human rights council has also documented the use of such bombs by both sides. 'Cluster munitions used by Russia and Ukraine are killing civilians now and will continue to do so for many years,' said Mary Wareham, acting arms director at Human Rights Watch. 'Both sides should immediately stop using them and not try to get more of these indiscriminate weapons.' Transferring cluster bombs to Ukraine would inevitably cause long-term suffering for civilians, the group said. It warned that the use of cluster munitions in areas with civilians makes an attack indiscriminate in violation of international humanitarian law, and possibly a war crime. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: Human Rights Watch has called on Russia and Ukraine to cease using cluster bombs due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term risks they pose to civilians.

{"prompt":"In the late 1990s, when I was a New York Times correspondent based in West Africa, international airline connections made passing through Paris a rite of both work and vacation. On one such visit, I received a shock that has stuck with me. As I approached a subway station not far from the Champs-Élysées, out of its stairwell came running two policemen, their guns drawn, as they pursued a young Black man whom they caught up to, badly manhandled, and then hauled away under arrest. As someone who had grown up in Washington, D.C., and recently moved to Africa from New York City—or simply as someone who had watched U.S. local news broadcasts and grown up consuming his country’s violent small- and large-screen offerings—I had been trained to think that urban scenes such as these were a unique product of my own country. On subsequent transits through Paris, I was disabused of yet more of my naivete when I began taking trains into the central city instead of taxis. Maybe it was a labor strike that had caused me to do this at first, but the experience so intrigued me that I began making a habit of it. Not even in New York had I felt such a gulf between the popular image of a city and this kind of lived experience of it via public transportation. For long sections of these rides, the cars were filled with Black and brown people–– overwhelmingly young and, I surmised, overwhelmingly either the children of recent immigrants or immigrants themselves, with France’s former colonies in North and sub-Saharan Africa the most likely places of origin. Before reaching the stylish, urban dreamland exalted in countless romantic Hollywood fantasies and more than a century of novels and travel writing, one must traverse something altogether different and discordant: a huge expanse of what the French rather delicately refer to as banlieues. They needn’t have resorted to the term, though. For many of these places, the old European word 'ghetto' would have fit just fine. Passing through and eventually visiting some of them, I was reminded of other grim cityscapes I have known in other parts of the world. The comparisons are admittedly not perfect, but segregated townships built under South African apartheid came to mind, as did some of the bleaker sections of New York where I had once paid dues as a local reporter, such as the more depressed parts of the Bronx.As with the notorious infrastructure schemes of the powerful New York master planner of the last century, Robert Moses, which deliberately isolated Black communities and cut them off from areas privileged in terms of race and class and from public amenities such as the city’s beaches, Paris’s banlieues are poorly connected to the city’s transportation system, heightening their economic and social isolation and therefore their misery. For those looking for points of optimism after France’s recent civil disturbances, projects underway or on the books are expected to dramatically increase subway connections for these long-neglected parts of the city. There is an old saw that holds that history never repeats itself but often rhymes. And it was just such a resonance—and not the recent events in Paris themselves, per se—that has brought France’s capital powerfully to mind for me.To briefly review those events, though: On June 27, a French teenager of Algerian descent was fatally shot by a police officer during a traffic stop in what amounted to a virtual execution. A video of the incident that was widely shared online shows a police officer shoot 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk at close range through his window as his car pulls away. Outraged young people, who were disproportionately 'of color,' then rose up in protests that lasted for six days and included numerous acts of looting, vandalism, and even violence. This, in turn, drew florid condemnations from broad segments of French society, with many people using racialized language or outright racism to denounce not just the protesters’ behavior, but also the growing presence of minority groups in France and the immigration that helps drive it. What has intrigued me here is a powerful coincidence of timing—and, as I will explore below, perhaps a deeper connection in terms of history and significance with a major decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. And therein, a paradox arises.France has long prided itself on its all-but-unique handling of racial diversity. Official policy comes close to pretending that such a thing does not exist and takes this for an unqualified positive. The republic is indivisible, says one often invoked phrase, and in the pursuit of its supposed universalism, France has made it illegal to collect data on the basis of a person’s race. If it is possible to glimpse some admirable idealism in France’s notion of universalism, it has an insufficiently acknowledged dark side as well. Firstly, it requires a near complete assimilation into the dominant national identity of we might call 'Frenchness,' which is overwhelmingly defined and policed by people of one race. This might even be considered one of its main, if unstated, features. In order to function, French universalism requires a charade: pretending to be colorblind. This colorblindness may help prevent French people from noticing that their television news industry or their cinema, to take two industries, are crushingly white, well beyond the true demographic breakdown of the society. But it does nothing to alleviate the underlying reality that opportunity still correlates strongly to race in the country. The same, for that matter, is true of life in the isolated banlieues, as opposed to the tonier parts of the city. I have little doubt that the same patterns hold in other spheres of society as well, from elite educational institutions to national politics. France’s readiest and most powerful counterexample is, of course, the United States, which has long served as an almost archetypical national 'other' to justify French policies and obtain buy-in from a French public that has been socialized over generations to view the United States both with haughty disdain and as a menace to the French way of life. Any idea of taking race or color into account in forming public policy is dismissed as succumbing to a dangerously corrupting Americanism. The recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that race-conscious college admissions programs violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection, however, suggests the French may have little to worry about on this score. The two countries would indeed appear to be converging in favor of the French way: pretending that color doesn’t exist and that race has no place in social policy. The Supreme Court ruling may have barred the overt consideration of race in college admissions in the United States, but it cannot pretend away the fact that Black students are dramatically underrepresented in higher education in the country, as they have been for generations—a product of actual policy during the United States’ long era of segregation and Jim Crow.In fact, as the University of Chicago law professor Sonja B. Starr has argued, racial gaps exist across a very wide range of categories in U.S. life, from income and employment rates to maternal mortality and life expectancy to exposure to toxic environmental pollution and incarceration. The question is: What are wealthy societies such as the United States and France to do about such realities? Overtly taking race into consideration clearly displeases large numbers of people in rich democracies, especially among those who have benefited most from inequality. If governments are not allowed to even weigh the racial facts before them, what realistic hope is there for public policy to redress these problems? ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 6, Summary: The author argues that France's emphasis on colorblindness and the suppression of race-related data prevents the acknowledgment of racial disparities and perpetuates inequality. The author also criticizes France's view of the United States as a negative influence and suggests that the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on race-conscious college admissions reflects a convergence between the two countries' approaches to race. While the article raises valid points about racial disparities and the challenges of addressing them, it seems to have a bias against France's universalism and its stance on race-related policies. The author's comparisons between France and the United States suggest a preference for the American approach, portraying it as more realistic in addressing racial issues. \n"}
{"prompt":"Corporations have already scaled back the diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts they launched in 2020 amid an ultimately stunted racial reckoning. Now the question is whether the Supreme Court’s ban on race-conscious admissions will lead them to further rein in these programs to avoid potential legal challenges. One thing is clear: The laws surrounding affirmative action in employment haven’t changed. Federal contractors have been required to take affirmative action, steps to ensure applicants are treated fairly, since 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11246. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s guidelines on voluntary affirmative action, employers are encouraged to take voluntary steps to 'correct the effects of past discrimination and to prevent present and future discrimination' such as expanding their applicant pools to ensure a diverse body of applicants for any given position. As the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission noted in a statement after the decision, the cases do not 'address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background,' clarifying that it is still legal for 'employers to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs that seek to ensure workers of all backgrounds are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace.' Still, legal threats from right-wing organizations that have already spent years trying to get organizations, including Starbucks and McDonald’s, to end their DEI programs could increase. The Supreme Court’s decision to ban race-conscious measures in college admissions is likely to encourage more lawsuits against race-conscious policies in employment, said Pauline Kim, an employment law expert at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. I talked to Kim about the future of diversity in the workforce and workplace and why affirmative action in college admissions and workplace hiring aren’t completely unrelated. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Fabiola Cineas What are the implications of the higher education affirmative action decision on employment? Pauline Kim The legal answer is nothing. The Harvard and UNC cases were decided under the equal protection clause of the Constitution, which does not apply to private employers. When it comes to affirmative action or discrimination in the workplace, private employers are covered by Title VII. It’s a different source of law. It’s not just a technical matter of being a different source of law, but there are actually differences in what Title VII holds compared to the equal protection clause precedents of the court. So on the purely legal technical level, there’s no direct implication.On the other hand, the Court in the higher ed affirmative action cases has expressed hostility to race-conscious efforts to improve racial equity. At that broad level, it may make employers worried about their own DEI programs. And that may encourage people who are ideologically inclined to challenge any kind of race-conscious or race-remedial efforts to try to bring lawsuits to challenge what employers are doing. There’s also a practical connection for employers, and I think it’s why so many of them weighed in on the university admissions case in favor of affirmative action. They are interested in hiring diverse workforces to meet the demands of their business in a global economy. They are worried about the pipeline of diverse candidates that are going to be available to them for hiring. Since affirmative action in higher ed is something that primarily affects the most elite schools, it could mean that employers may need to move beyond looking at the status of a college or university that somebody attended. They’ll need to look more broadly at students coming from varied educational backgrounds who may have the skills and ability to do the work. Fabiola Cineas What’s the history behind Title VII? Pauline Kim Title VII is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was the groundbreaking legislation that Congress passed in the wake of the civil rights protests of the ’50s and early ’60s. Under Title VII, it’s unlawful for an employer to take an adverse action against an employee or an applicant because of their sex, national origin, religion, or color. Title VII was intended to protect Black workers as well as women and other ethnic minorities. Prior to 1964, employers were free to make employment decisions on any of those bases if they wanted to. After Title VII was passed, in addition to prohibiting intentional discrimination, the Court also made clear that if an employer has a practice that has a disparate impact on disadvantaged groups, then that’s a form of discrimination as well, unless the employer can justify it for business reasons. So a lot of employers realized they had a problem.Some employers were sued, and they entered into either consent judgments or there were court judgments entered, and then there were permanent affirmative action plans put into place. Other employers realized they needed to voluntarily adopt traditional kinds of affirmative action plans. Over time, as discrimination became latent, employers moved away from affirmative action plans that involved any kinds of racial quotas. They have really shifted their focus to examining their policies and moving towards what’s now called DEI initiatives. Fabiola Cineas Can we take a step back to first even define affirmative action in the workplace context? Does affirmative action in workplace hiring look the same as affirmative action in higher education admissions? Pauline Kim Part of the problem is affirmative action, both within the employment space but also more generally, means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. So there’s often confusion about what exactly it entails. In some of the older cases, affirmative action literally meant that a spot might be reserved, for example, for somebody from a racial minority group. That practice has long since been abandoned by universities and employers. Affirmative action also could refer to a program or policy, where the effort is to diversify either the university class or the workforce, where race or sex is taken into account as a positive. Sometimes people also use the term affirmative action to mean taking any kind of step that will help to improve racial equity or to improve the diversity of a pool. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The article discusses the implications of the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on race-conscious admissions and its potential impact on diversity and affirmative action in employment.

{"prompt":"Barring any delays over legal issues, Iowa is poised to enact a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before most women know they are pregnant. The ban has exceptions for cases where the life or health of the mother is in danger and for survivors of rape and incest, miscarriages, and certain fetal diagnoses. Abortion providers challenged the ban in state court Wednesday on the basis that it violates Iowans’ constitutional rights to abortion and substantive due process, as well as the state constitution’s inalienable rights clause, which they argue guarantees those rights to women specifically and grants them equal protection under the law. They are asking the court to temporarily prevent the law from going into effect on Friday, when Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has indicated that she intends to sign it. 'If this abortion ban goes into effect, it will place an unacceptable burden on patients’ ability to access essential abortion care, especially those who already face systemic inequities. Hundreds of Iowans will be impacted in mere weeks,' Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said in a statement. The law is practically identical to one passed in 2018 that was permanently blocked by a state court in a decision upheld by the Iowa Supreme Court last month. In response, Reynolds called a special session Tuesday with the singular purpose of passing the new law, which she maintains is reflective of Iowans’ values. 'Iowans have elected representatives willing to stand up for the rights of the unborn and, in doing so, they have voted strongly in support of pro-life principles and against the arbitrary destruction of innocent, defenseless lives,' Reynolds said in a statement announcing the special session. However, polling suggests that Iowans feel differently. A Des Moines Register-Mediacom Iowa poll conducted earlier this year found that 61 percent of Iowa adults supported legal abortion in all or most cases, and only 35 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases.Still, openly anti-abortion Republicans continue to win elections in Iowa, which has taken a hard-right turn in recent election cycles. And Republican lawmakers are taking that as a carte blanche to advance their ultra-conservative agenda, including an abortion ban among the most restrictive in the country. What the ban means for Iowans — and the region The exceptions to the ban are limited, and Republican lawmakers rejected amendments proposed by Democrats that would have expanded them. The organizations challenging the law, including Planned Parenthood North Central States, the Emma Goldman Clinic, and the ACLU of Iowa, said in a joint statement that people who do meet the criteria for an exception will face 'barriers to care' and that 'the reality is that abortion will be largely unavailable for most vulnerable Iowans that might try to rely upon these exceptions.' We’ve already seen massive reductions in care in other states that have enacted abortion bans. In Texas, for example, doctors are put in the position of having to determine whether the life or health of the pregnant person is endangered. That’s led to delays in performing abortions, putting patients at further risk for complications. If Iowans can’t access abortion in-state, only those with the necessary financial resources may be able to do so elsewhere, and even then, they could face hurdles. Abortion access in the Midwest has severely contracted since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. Now, Wisconsin, Missouri, and the Dakotas have implemented bans on almost all abortions. Indiana will also implement its own ban starting in August.Should Iowa join those states in severely curtailing abortion access, other states in the region will likely be under further pressure to provide abortions to out-of-state patients. That includes Michigan, where voters resoundingly approved a ballot measure last fall to codify abortion rights in the state constitution. The state has already seen a significant increase in out-of-state patients in the last year, with Michigan doctors performing 2,761 abortions on such patients in 2022 compared to 1,665 in 2021, according to state data obtained by Bridge Michigan. Planned Parenthood, which operates 14 clinics in the state, has seen its out-of-state patient load nearly triple since the end of Roe.The question is whether they can continue to expand their capacity to meet increasing demand from out-of-state patients. Many blue states have increased government funding for family planning service providers like Planned Parenthood, and the organization itself is redirecting resources toward clinics that are seeing higher demand, but staffing shortages and rising costs remain a concern. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The article discusses the imminent ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in Iowa and the legal challenges faced by abortion providers.

{"prompt":"FIRST ON FOX: The University of South Carolina’s College of Education prepares teachers to 'dismantle' racism with 'culturally responsive teaching,' though a state budget proviso prohibits critical race theory instruction in public schools. The College of Education supports teachers who 'act as change agents to dismantle, eliminate, and replace institutional and individual injustices,' a document obtained by Fox News Digital detailing the college’s goals for the future said. The university’s education program commits to developing its students’ ability to 'identify individual and systemic privilege, disenfranchisement, oppression, and silencing' while affirming students’ expertise regarding race, gender identification, sexual orientation, and more. Adam Mahdavi, a 2022 University of South Carolina graduate, said he felt the education faculty targeted White, straight, Christian males like himself. 'If you're vocal about your Christianity, conservatism, constitutional Republicanism, if you voice that out, you will be a target every single day,' Mahdavi told Fox Digital. 'And they'll try to make you want to quit.'The education college offers a number of courses that prepare future educators to integrate critical race theory into their classrooms. A course preparing future middle school teachers to construct curriculum contains overarching themes of 'social justice & antiracism,' according to Mahdavi’s fall 2021 course syllabus. 'Antiracist education is a theory of learning and action to help us do the important work of dismantling racism in schools,' the syllabus reads. 'Given this, the course stands on the beliefs that teacher candidates should be reflective, responsive teacher-leaders who effectively address the inequities of policies, practices, and achievement related to race, gender, class, and linguistic differences.' The course, titled 'Integrated Curriculum at the Middle Level,' explores 'culturally responsive teaching' to help sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade teachers understand how curriculum 'acts as a gatekeeper to future opportunities for children from different ethnic groups and low socioeconomic backgrounds.' The syllabus claims the course content is consistent with USC education department’s mission, which includes preparing teachers 'to be proficient in culturally relevant, anti-racist, pro-Black instruction; and to promote democratic principles and ideas within and across all educational settings.' The College of Education's mission statement was taken down from the website following Fox News Digital's inquiry and now goes to a 404 page.The professor assigned students in the EDTE 522 course a 'critical synthesis' project, where students identified the implications of bias, discrimination and educational inequities in a 10-12 minute podcast. The rubric for the assignment names two themes: 'anti-racism education as it relates to teaching and planning curriculum for middle level students' and 'addressing issues of bias, discrimination, and educational inequities through integrated curriculum for middle level students.'Another course, called 'Antiracist Education,' covers topics including 'individual and institutional racism, overt and covert racism, curriculum, textbooks, power relationships, teacher-student relationships, and privacy.'

{"prompt":"The Trump administration is reportedly sending armed and highly trained law enforcement units to sanctuary cities across the country to support US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in carrying out immigration raids. As first reported by the New York Times, 100 US Customs and Border Protection officers, including those from the SWAT-like Border Patrol Tactical Unit, will be deployed from February through May across nine sanctuary cities: Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, and Newark, NJ. Border Patrol Tactical Unit agents receive special training for high-risk law enforcement activities, including sniper certification and other advanced weapons training. Their primary charge has been tracking down drug traffickers on the US-Mexico border, where violence can often break out, but now they will also be responsible for conducting routine immigration arrests in some of America’s largest cities, according to the Times. It’s just the latest instance in which President Donald Trump has sought to target sanctuary cities — which do not allow local law enforcement to share information with ICE or hand over immigrants in their custody — for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Immigrants advocates say that the deployment is not only a waste of federal law enforcement resources, it also might endanger immigrant communities. 'This is transparent retaliation against local governments for refusing to do the administration’s bidding,' Naureen Shah, senior policy and advocacy counsel on immigrants’ rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. 'It will put lives at risk by further militarizing our streets.' Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Heather Swift said in a statement Friday that the additional CBP agents (which she emphasized come from a variety backgrounds and not just tactical units) will help overstretched ICE officers deal with the rising number of immigrants who could be arrested on immigration violations but have yet to be detained.'ICE does not have sufficient resources to effectively manage the sustained increase in non-detained cases which is exacerbated by the rise of sanctuary jurisdictions,' she said. 'These officers have also been trained in routine immigration enforcement actions, which is what they have been asked to do.' It’s all part of Trump’s campaign against sanctuary cities Friday’s decision is just one in a long line of Trump’s attempts to crack down on sanctuary cities. The administration has tried to withhold federal law enforcement grants from sanctuary states and vacate California’s sanctuary laws (but has mostly failed). And it recently blocked New Yorkers from enrolling in Global Entry and other programs that offer faster processing for pre-vetted travelers in response to new state sanctuary laws. At his State of the Union address earlier this month, Trump characterized sanctuary cities as a danger to public safety and broadly painted immigrants as violent criminals, highlighting a case of an immigrant arrested on charges of murdering and sexually assaulting a 92-year-old woman in New York City. Trump has done this over and over during his time in office, turning his ire on international criminal gangs like MS-13 and invoking the stories of 'angel moms,' parents of those killed by gang members. But in reality, research suggests that his characterization doesn’t hold water: Sanctuary policies don’t appear to make a city more dangerous. While there isn’t a huge body of research on sanctuary policies’ impact on crime rates, studies have found that they either slightly decrease crime rates or have no effect. A study published in the journal Urban Affairs Review in 2017 found that cities with similar characteristics but for their sanctuary policies had 'no statistically discernible difference' in their rates of violent crime, rape, or property crime. Using data from the National Immigration Law Center and the FBI, researchers compared crime rates before and after cities passed sanctuary laws, finding that they had no effect on crime.Another study by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, examined the almost 2,500 counties that don’t accept requests from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain unauthorized immigrants. The study found that counties with sanctuary policies tend to have lower crime rates than those that don’t: about 35.5 fewer crimes per 10,000 people on average. The counties with the smallest populations exhibited even bigger differences in crime rates. Many police chiefs say there’s good reason behind those results: Sanctuary policies facilitate better crime reporting and cooperation with law enforcement in criminal investigations. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 5, Summary: The article reports that the Trump administration plans to deploy armed and highly trained law enforcement units to sanctuary cities across the country to assist in immigration raids. It highlights that the Border Patrol Tactical Unit agents, known for their high-risk law enforcement activities, will now be responsible for conducting routine immigration arrests in major cities. The article suggests that this move is retaliation against sanctuary cities for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and argues that it could endanger immigrant communities and militarize the streets. It also provides evidence suggesting that sanctuary policies do not increase crime rates and that they can facilitate better crime reporting and cooperation with law enforcement. The article leans towards a left-leaning perspective, criticizing the Trump administration's crackdown on sanctuary cities and highlighting the potential negative consequences of the deployment.\n"}
{"prompt":"At 26, Ixchel Hernandez has become the defender and protector of her family’s modest apartment. In the two decades they’ve lived in their Los Angeles home, the family of four has successfully fought against multiple attempts aimed at pricing and, ultimately, forcing them out. 'We are human beings with the right to live in our home, and that’s just frankly what every person… in every home and [in] every building should know … they have the right to have their own space, to have their home,' Hernandez said. But, across the country, affordable housing is becoming increasingly rare to find. The lack of housing inventory, coupled with inflation and zoning inequalities, has required families to stretch more to find housing — and even priced out most families, especially those who start with little-to-no capital of their own.Ixchel’s parents moved to the United States from Mexico in hopes of giving her and her brother opportunities and a safe environment. Her father, Jose Hernandez, never wanted to give the family’s various landlords a reason to evict them over the years, and he dreamed of owning his own home one day. 'Thank God we never failed to pay our rent,' he said. But in order to keep up with rising rents, both parents worked and even opened up their home to another family for a brief time. Ixchel remembers six people crammed into their one-bedroom apartment. 'It shouldn’t have to be that way where you’re kind of fighting for space or you’re going to have to move so far out of LA to be able to have a home,' she said. To purchase a house in more than 75% of the nation’s most populous cities, an average family needs to spend at least 30% of their annual income on housing. In cities like Miami, New York and Los Angeles, that number surges to more than 80% of an average family’s annual income. Home ownership for the Hernandez family, and so many others, has felt like a fading American dream. That is until they discovered a Civil Rights era approach that helps promote home ownership, particularly among minority groups, who are disproportionately impacted by the affordable housing crisis. It’s called a Community Land Trust, or CLT. 'We’re operated by residents who actually live in our building… [as well as] folks from the communities that we’re serving,' said Kasey Ventura of the Beverly-Vermont Community Land Trust. 'My interest in this work, outside of just preserving housing and affordable housing, is preserving culture in a community.' A CLT is essentially a nonprofit organization that buys the land on which a building sits, thereby allowing a community’s residents to collectively manage it. Some residents eventually choose to form a co-op with their neighbors and take ownership of their buildings, renting the land. The Hernandez family and their neighbors embraced the concept. This year they joined the Beverly-Vermont CLT, one of at least five in Los Angeles and more than 200 nationwide. The process requires neighbors to meet regularly over several months before ultimately unanimously agreeing on various terms so as to finalize the trust. Ixchel now sits on the board of her building’s management; it’s in the final stages of ownership transfer to the co-op. 'What’s important is that we’re now owners!' said Ixchel’s mother, Guadalupe Santiago. 'But it’s also important to remember it was not easy,' her father cautioned. 'It may not seem like a lot to a lot of folks that have money or come from money,' Ixchel said. '[But] we are just as much trying to build that generational wealth.' A US housing shortage According to 2019 figures, the United States was roughly 3.8 million homes short of what was needed to house families. That is more than double the number from a decade earlier. California has the largest housing deficit of any other state, requiring an estimated million more homes to meet housing demands. 'We don’t necessarily view housing as a need that everybody should have. And that’s key… in this work,' said Kasey Ventura, who helps run the Beverly-Vermont Community Land Trust in Los Angeles. While CLTs are a solution, Ventura admits there are — and should be — other affordable housing options to adequately address the crisis. In Southern California, there is growing demand for construction and rental of ADUs, or Accessory Dwelling Units. Also called 'carriage homes,' the converted garages or newly built smaller structures sit adjacent to existing homes and are on the same property. The mostly studio or one-bedroom apartments provide a more affordable option to many who prefer to live or work in areas that might otherwise be too expensive. Others have advocated for utilizing unoccupied homes. There are dozens of vacant houses, in some cases, sitting just a few blocks from several homeless encampments lining many Los Angeles sidewalks. However, efforts to transform them into affordable housing in some neighborhoods have proven controversial among existing homeowners. Another route undertaken by some companies is Employer-Assisted Housing. Although they have only finished a portion of what they initially pledged, in recent years corporations like Google, Meta and Apple have promised to spend billions of dollars on some 40,000 new homes in California. The initiative began in order to combat soaring home prices in the Bay Area, while also recruiting and retaining talent who needed more affordable housing options, along with a shorter commute to the office. 'Just to be able to be like, ‘Okay, I’m gonna wake up, take a walk down the street and come to work.’ I mean that’s awesome!' said Matthew Johnson, an employee of Factory_OS in Vallejo, California, which already plans to provide workforce housing options to its workers in the coming years. However, unlike other companies, Factory_OS employees will build their own homes. ‘We’re building houses for the people who need them’ In a space once used to build US Navy submarines during World War II, Larry Pace now operates Factory_OS outside San Francisco. He co-founded the company with Rick Holliday to address the worsening housing shortage.'That we’ve repurposed a building that was once for instruments of war, [so as] to [now] create affordable and supportive housing…. I don’t know how much cooler that can be,' said Pace. Factory_OS puts homebuilding onto an assembly line and produces fully finished modular units within two weeks. From insulation and drywall to flooring, fixtures and paint, all of it is prefabricated within the confines of the factory before it’s trucked to a site for assembly. 'We’ve created an IKEA for the manufacturing of homes,' said Pace. 'Then we put the pieces together.' When hoisted by a crane and stacked like sophisticated Legos, the modular units combine to make entire apartment buildings. Pace maintains there are massive cost-savings and huge efficiencies in moving homebuilding into a factory setting compared with on-site construction. 'We’re building houses for the people who need them, for the people who have been struggling to be able to support their families or pay rent or pay bills,' said Johnson, as he placed support beams for a roof of one of the units. The 38-year-old Factory_OS employee and father of five was once homeless, and he said he often thinks about the families who will one day live under the roof he’s assembling. w 'Every morning I wake up, I’m grateful… that I come home from work and there are my kids waiting for me,' said Johnson. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The article discusses the challenges faced by families in finding affordable housing in the United States and explores different solutions, such as Community Land Trusts (CLTs) and modular home construction.

{"prompt":"The Supreme Court that erased a constitutional right to abortion 10 months ago took a breath on Friday. In a brief order, over only two publicly dissenting justices, the majority preserved the current law and present-day access to medication abortion. That is the predominant method, in contrast to surgical abortion, used by women in the US seeking to end a pregnancy in the early stages.The majority separated itself from individual lower court judges – all appointees of former President Donald Trump – who this month had demonstrated a zeal to further reduce access to abortion across the country.The Supreme Court’s order Friday night reflected a willingness to step back – at least for now – in the dispute that tests the US Food and Drug Administration’s expertise, as well as the premise of the court’s own decision last June that individual states may make their own determinations on the legality of abortion. Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito were the only justices who noted their dissent, and Alito, alone, explained his view. Alito, the author of last June’s decision reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade, derided the Biden administration’s warnings about the regulatory chaos that would arise if the abortion drug was suddenly restricted. He also claimed that 'the Government has not dispelled legitimate doubts that it would even obey an unfavorable order,' an assertion that was outright contrary to Biden administration officials’ comments that they would follow court orders even as they continued to appeal. No other justice signed onto Alito’s four-page statement. Last June, the Alito majority emphasized the role of individual states in the abortion rights dilemma. 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s representatives,' Alito had written in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a separate concurring statement that insisted judges would no longer be engaged in the 'difficult moral and policy questions' of abortion.'To be clear, then,' Kavanaugh had added, 'the Court’s decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States.' But without the mifepristone drug option at the center of the new controversy, access to abortion would be significantly undermined in wide swaths of the US. While states regulate abortion, and a majority continue to make it legal, the federal FDA has the authority for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the medication that is used to end a pregnancy.The justices on Friday granted a request by the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco to suspend the effect of the lower court rulings that sought to overturn or cut back FDA’s approval for mifepristone, the first pill of a two-drug abortion protocol. FDA authorization of mifepristone traces back to 2000, and since the high court reversed Roe v. Wade last June and some states began instituting bans on the procedure, the drug’s availability has become even more crucial for women’s ability to terminate a pregnancy. The three other justices who had joined Alito and Thomas in reversing Roe last summer – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – were silent on Friday. At least one of them would have been needed to constitute the requisite majority of five justices, if combined with the three liberals who have supported abortion rights (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) and with Chief Justice John Roberts. Last summer, Roberts tried to persuade his fellow conservatives to hold off on reversing Roe even as he agreed with their move to uphold a groundbreaking Mississippi state ban on abortions at 15-weeks.Role of Roberts Friday’s action in the new case may represent a measure of success for Roberts in the divisive area of reproductive rights. The chief justice had failed to bring together the right and left sides of the court in Dobbs, writing then, 'Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. … I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after 15 weeks.' Roberts on Friday declined to record his vote or views publicly, but he likely favored the slower approach to litigation that constitutes a major attack on the FDA’s approval process for all drugs. Many polls have shown the court’s overall public approval plunging as the conservative majority has rolled back decades-old precedent. Unhappy Alito The only justice who put his full sentiment down on paper was Alito, who had controlled the sweeping decision overturning nearly a half century of women’s privacy rights related to pregnancy. He spurned the Biden administration’s arguments about the chaos and harm that would arise if the use of mifepristone were curtailed. The combined lower court orders in the case would have prevented the drug from being prescribed after seven weeks of pregnancy. It now extends to 10 weeks of pregnancy. The lower court action also would have reinstituted a requirement that women pick up the drug in-person, rather than obtain by mail after consulting with health care providers. Further, new restrictions on dosage would have been put in place and a generic drug that now accounts for most of the market would have been eliminated.Alito minimized those possible changes, stressing that mifepristone would remain the market. However, the FDA had said that if certain restrictions were imposed, mifepristone would be rendered mislabeled and misbranded – a situation that would take months to remedy. US district court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an enduring opponent of abortion rights, had handled the first phase of the lawsuit and laid bare his policy and moral preferences. He shunned the widely used term 'fetus,' which the justices themselves have invoked, and instead referred to the 'unborn human' and 'unborn child.' Kacsmaryk had been specifically sought out by anti-abortion physicians and medical groups who filed the lawsuit in his Amarillo, Texas, district. In his April 7 decision invalidating FDA approval of mifepristone, he rejected the agency’s 23-year determination that the pill was safe and effective. 'The Court,' Kacsmaryk wrote of his findings, 'does not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly. But here, FDA acquiesced in its legitimate safety concerns – in violation of its statutory duty – based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions.' The FDA, physicians and drug makers widely disparaged Kacsmaryk’s usurping of the agency’s scientific expertise. A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld significant portions of Kacsmaryk’s ruling, by a 2-1 vote. Most importantly, it agreed that anti-abortion physicians and medical groups could challenge the drug even though they do not prescribe it, brushing aside the Biden administration’s arguments that the challengers lacked legal 'standing' to sue. The 5th Circuit has set a May 17 date for a full airing of the lawsuit against the FDA, and that proceeding is on schedule. The difference now is that full FDA approval and regulations since 2016 that enhanced access to the drug will remain in place during the litigation. The high court’s order, siding with the FDA at this preliminary point, may newly influence how lower court judges regard the litigation and shift the emphasis in this new chapter of America’s ongoing abortion wars. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The article discusses a recent Supreme Court order that preserves access to medication abortion by suspending lower court rulings that sought to restrict the FDA's approval of the abortion drug mifepristone.

{"prompt":"Raise your hand if you've been branded as 'that crazy parent.' (Hand raised.) I've had my microphone turned off at board meetings, been reprimanded by a local teachers’ union leader, and publicly assassinated by social justice moms for vocally opposing activism in my children's former school district. I've complained about our current education system and am exhausted from confrontation. But, I refuse to be quiet and quit on our country's future. These days, conservatives get a bad rap for contesting things we don't consider fit for our education system—from explicit books in classrooms to school-sanctioned racism. This year, let's stop complaining and instead commit to action-based solutions. Here are four effective ways to fight woke practices in schools. 1. Opt your child out of SEL surveys, sex-ed, and DEI activities Social Emotional Learning (SEL), 'gender non-conforming' initiatives, and 'culturally-responsive and restorative' Diversity, Equity & Inclusion programs are fancy words for victim-versus-oppressor initiatives. SEL surveys mine sensitive information from our children, sex education is now taught through a radicalized, 'pleasure-based' lens, and most standard DEI programs aim to usher in race-based affinity groups and\/or activism not appropriate for minors—all without our expressed parental consent and on our taxpayer dime. So, let’s each opt our kids out of these divisive directives preemptively (with written notification to your district and school), to protect our children and send a stern message that we will not tolerate nonsense force-fed to our kids. 2. Donate good books The last few decades, our school system has stripped children of learning through classic literature that flexes their brains. Instead of vocabulary and virtue through stories like 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,' social justice and sexualized lessons now force kids to tackle complex topics like being 'Gender Queer' through graphic illustrations and\/or explicit material labeled 'inclusive.' 'Conservatives want to ban books!' they wail when we criticize inappropriate literature in school classrooms and libraries. Let’s instead be proactive, provide alternatives, and donate the kinds of books we want made available on library shelves. 3. File a FOIA request FOIA stands for Freedom of Information Act—which requires disclosure of public records upon request and is valid in all 50 states. Parents have a right, protected by law, to know what's happening in classrooms and what’s being said in communications between teachers and administrators if reasonable cause is presented. Submitting a FOIA request is free, and allows us to access emails, curriculum details, paper trails and more. Filing a FOIA request communicates that you are actively engaged, unafraid to ask questions, and serious about demanding accountability. PragerU offers an introductory Parent Action Guide to get you started with step-by-step instructions for taking an active role in your children’s education. 4. Teach knowledge at home The decades-long dismantling of knowledge-based curriculum opened the door for unproven methods like 'child-led learning' and project-based lessons, which ultimately don't teach children how to think, how to reason, or much of anything else. It's our job, as parents, to cultivate an appetite for knowledge, so we may restore cultural literacy for a cohesive, informed nation. Since we can no longer rely on public or private schools to provide the kind of education we desire for our children, we must harness outside resources to help us guide our children toward the type of education that raises reasonable citizens. There are dozens of resources now, PragerU Kids being one of them, that are designed to teach children the values of hard work, real knowledge, history and civilization, and equality of opportunity—things that will inevitably serve as an inoculation against woke efforts inside a classroom. Taking positive control of our primary parental responsibility to educate our kids is arguably the most satisfying way to school our failing system. And you can always speak your mind at those pesky school board meetings, too. Be brave. Our country’s future depends on it. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right,  Magnitude of Bias: 8 Summary: The article is written from a conservative perspective and discusses strategies for parents to combat what they perceive as woke practices in schools.

{"prompt":"On June 28, President Joe Biden took to the stage in Chicago to drum up support for his economic agenda, which his own team has taken to calling 'Bidenomics.' The speech was part of a broader publicity tour, 'Investing in America,' with the president and his cabinet traveling the country trying to get the American people to see Biden’s economic policies as successful and popular. In his speech, the president attacked so-called trickle-down economics, which he painted as the dominant economic policy of the American government for decades. He then defined his agenda, Bidenomics, as a 'new philosophy' set to 'restore the American Dream.' But Bidenomics isn’t a new philosophy. If you look at what’s been enacted and what’s still being proposed, it becomes clear that all Biden is doing is ramping up the federal government’s industrial policy. And industrial policy has, unfortunately, been around for a long time—as have its effects. When governments pursue industrial policies, they attempt a form of entrepreneurship. And in doing so, they divert scarce resources and capital away from the production of goods and services that people actually want, freed from the feedback of the market. Bidenomics won’t restore the American Dream but will do it damage. All the fancy, focus-group-approved economic talking points the administration is now spamming us with begin to unravel when one understands basic economic truths. Chief among these truths is that the economy is a process—not a state of being. Specifically, it’s a process for producing goods and services that satisfy the needs and wants of consumers. Every part of every line of production is a means toward that end. For an economy to grow and everyone to become wealthier, some people need to take on the role of an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs reallocate resources to new lines of production or refine existing lines to account for changing factors like technology, capital availability, and consumer preferences. This activity is undertaken with the purpose of producing or contributing to the production of goods and services that consumers value enough to pay for.In a market unhampered by a government, the resources and capital used in production are the property of capitalist-entrepreneurs. That means they have control over how these inputs get used. And, because they also own the produced outputs, the capitalist-entrepreneurs are personally subjected to the constant and unignorable feedback of the profit and loss system. Consumers on the free market can opt out of any exchange for any reason. That’s why capitalist-entrepreneurs can only make profits if they produce things consumers value. When they don’t, they are stuck with the losses. Economic losses are a motivating signal that the resources used in a line of production would be better used elsewhere. How does Bidenomics fit into all of this? Again, one could describe much of Biden’s economic agenda as ramping up industrial policy—meaning the government is attempting entrepreneurship. Political officials are using tax dollars to acquire resources that they then allocate to new production lines. Bidenomics also entails using tax-funded subsidies to get private investors to fund projects they wouldn’t have chosen otherwise. All these tax dollars pouring into new projects allow the administration to brag about creating jobs and producing stuff, which sounds good in a campaign speech, regardless of whether the end consumers value these things as the best use of scarce resources. From a purely practical standpoint, the federal government cannot help but be a terrible entrepreneur because it is immune from economic losses. The American people are legally prohibited from opting out of their payments to the government as they are allowed to do with any other organization. As such, the government can spend decades on wasteful projects of little to no value and face no direct economic consequences. On top of that, the lack of feedback can allow the government’s operations to drift further away from reality as scarce resources go wasted and consumer needs go unmet. Entrepreneurship is an essential part of a growing economy. But the wealth creation brought about by entrepreneurship is only truly possible with the freedom and feedback under private property. The quasi entrepreneurship taken on by the government in the president’s economic agenda siphons scarce resources away from more valuable uses and into projects protected from the critical feedback of economic losses. Policies like this aren’t going to 'restore the American Dream'; they’re the very thing killing it. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 8, Summary: The article criticizes President Joe Biden's economic agenda, which is referred to as Bidenomics, and argues that it is essentially an expansion of the federal government's industrial policy.

{"prompt":"The Democratic Socialists of America promotes a supposedly pro-Indigenous people platform. They stress that they do not want to further the 'dispossession and exploitation of Indigenous people' while also recognizing the sovereignty of Native Americans. The Communist Party USA’s political program also stresses the inclusion of Indigenous people in the working-class movement. While these organizations are partially right in calling for the recognition of tribal sovereignty (free enterprise would help more than socialism), they must also recognize the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union, the representative of twentieth-century socialism, against the native tribes of Siberia. I alluded to the abuses of minority groups by the Soviet Union in a recent article, but I did not go into much detail regarding the exploitation. The abuse of the native Siberians provides a case study. Upon solidifying their control of Russia, the Bolsheviks inherited a vast swath of the land known as Siberia. They would use this land for their gulags, but there was also the issue of the native tribes. Historian Benson Bobrick describes the abuses inflicted upon the native Siberians in his book East of the Sun. Although the Soviets proclaimed sovereignty for the 'different nationalities' in Russia, the Siberians’ fate was not kind. Rather than simply allowing the natives to have autonomy, the Soviets set up the Committee of Assistance to the Peoples of the North. This was the beginning of the cruel joke of sovereignty under the Soviets, which was not real sovereignty in the slightest. The Soviet structure gave no 'real autonomy'; the Siberians were essentially under the direction of Russian bureaucrats. While there were some improvements to hygiene and healthcare (such would be expected when giving aid to a more-or-less primitive society), the Soviets took steps that frustrated and broke down Siberian culture. Initially, the Roman-based alphabets of the native languages were replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet; the state encouraged the study of the Russian, rather than native, language. This is a tendency seen in many imperialistic endeavors. (For another example, the British crown banned the Gaelic language in Scotland in 1616.) Shamans and other leaders were eliminated through dekulakization, Tartar mosques were closed, temples were destroyed, and native farming habits were forcibly displaced by the chaotic methods of central planners. The Cossacks were treated in a similar manner through de-Cossackization, which was the systematic deportation and execution of the Cossacks, another Siberian minority group. The Arctic Siberians were managed by state planners sent to make sure that reindeer herding kept to the official plan, a plan that in no way could account for the thousands of years of specialized knowledge that the Siberians had developed with their unique agricultural methods. The contrast between the Soviets and the Siberians was most evident when the communist modes of production were imposed on the primitive 'communism' of the Siberians. Bobrick states: Although at first the government supposed that primitive native communism would make concepts of modern communism easier to apply, native ideas of sharing were found to be too generous, notably disconnected from the labor theory of value, and their failure to distinguish between work and leisure judged to be 'unproductive' and 'ideologically wrong.'The Soviets were trying to fit a square through a circular hole. Official plans could not account for the needs of the population. No matter, though. The bureaucrats continued their work on the Siberians. When World War II began, '20 percent of the total native population was conscripted and sent to the front,' forced to fight a war they had no stake in. Rather than giving the Siberians autonomy, the Soviets micromanaged the Siberians’ affairs and, when war broke out, sent a large portion of the population to the front lines to die for Mother Russia. The natives were treated as resources to be shifted around and disposed of rather than as free peoples. Bobrick continues to tell of the native people’s dealings with the Soviet Union, but the details highlighted above are the most glaring injustices. Today, the Siberians are still under the yoke of Russia, albeit as a less authoritarian regime; however, parallels abound. The war in Ukraine is leading to the conscription of native Siberians. A modern approach to the question of native sovereignty is simple. Siberians should be allowed to secede from Russia or become completely autonomous regions, allowing spontaneous arrangements to reign rather than central controls. The same goes for the native tribes in the United States and the rest of the world, rather than repeating the mistakes made by Russia’s Soviet forebearers. Defenders of the free market should acknowledge this solution, but so should the socialists. In keeping with their various platforms, modern socialists should fully acknowledge the abuses of native Siberians by the Soviet Union and actively advocate for Siberian sovereignty, just as they do for Native Americans. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 8, Summary: The article criticizes the Democratic Socialists of America and the Communist Party USA for their supposed support of Indigenous people while ignoring the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union against the native tribes of Siberia.

{"prompt":"Mueller Report: Did Assange, GRU Conspire Since 2010? Posted by Louise Mensch Bob Mueller’s most forgotten piece of work is his indictment of the 12 GRU officers. If anybody was paying attention, the Special Counsel, in his core indictment of the Russian state, said the GRU didn’t do it alone. They had help, he said, from persons 'known and unknown' to the Grand Jury. These persons colluded 'knowingly and wittingly', and Mueller referred to them and the 12 Russian officers as a single entity: ‘The Conspirators'. Did Wikileaks, Assange and the GRU conspire against America in 2016? This piece argues between that indictment, Julian Assange’s indictment, and a filing in the Roger Stone case, Mueller has shown his plans. Cases will show Wikileaks worked with the GRU to hack the Democrats. And Assange partnered with them since 2010.Who Were Russia’s Little Helpers? In our articles analyzing the Mueller Report, we suggested that Bob Mueller laid a trap for Attorney General Bill Barr. Mueller established, in volume 1 of his report, that the Trump Campaign coordinated with Wikileaks. He said that the evidence did not establish collusion with the Russian government. Barr went much further in his press conference, telling America that this was not a crime because Wikileaks just published the GRU’s material and didn’t conspire with them to do the hacking itself. As we’ve pointed out, if Assange and GRU did conspire in the hack, Mr. Barr has conceded the criminality of the entire Trump Campaign at a national podium. So let’s get down to it. Did Wikileaks conspire with the GRU, not just to publish their materials, but in the hacking itself? GRU Co-Conspirators Are Legally the Russian State First, let’s take a quick look at the indictment of the GRU military officers, who are definitively ‘the Russian government’. The most important part, for our purposes, is at the beginning.'Duh', I hear you say. But bear with me. Here, Mueller and the DC prosecutors lay out with brutal clarity that, in the persons of the GRU officers acting as its instrument, the Russian Federation itself (the Russian Government) conducted a conspiracy against the United States to disrupt the election. Why this matters: Because Mueller was investigating the attack and links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. The GRU are the Russian government; any persons who conspired with them to hack America are part of the Russian government’s action, legally. Russia’s attack, Mueller says in a single sentence, comprised ‘the staged release of documents stolen through computer intrusions’. 'Staged' means that Mueller considers the curation, the ‘big impact’, of releases, to be a core part of the conspiracy. ‘Documents stolen’ comes second in the sentence. ‘Computer intrusions’ can mean both hacking and phishing. Conspirators Aren’t Americans – But Could Be Australian The defendants, he says, were GRU officers who knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other, and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury (collectively the 'Conspirators'), to gain unauthorized access (to 'hack') into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This, the most overlooked part of the indictment, is the bit that should make Julian Assange wet his pants in fear. Mueller says 'the Conspirators' worked with other felons to hack the election. Felons whose names are known to the Grand Jury. They conspired knowingly and intentionally. That means that these unnamed defendants or future defendants, according to Mueller, were not just publishers. They collaborated in stealing the documents, and staging their release. Mueller has also concluded his investigation into Americans who worked with the Russian government. So, these secret, 'known to the Grand Jury', other conspirators with the GRU’s hacking – the direct conspirators, who knowingly worked with the Russian state – were not Americans. But they could have been Australians – and citizens of other countries, like Europe.‘Collectively, 'The Conspirators'‘ SCO tells us here that the hack on America and its dissemination was not just carried out by the GRU. It was the GRU + these unknown persons. And he refers to them all as a single group. Both are guilty, and equally representative of the Russian state. ONE ENTITY. That’s what 'conspiracy' does for you. Now, let’s look and see if Mr. Mueller left any ‘GRU Clues’ for us to pick up on. First, after Roger Stone was indicted, Mueller added the GRU case to Stone’s case as a ‘related’ case based on the common search warrant and underlying criminal contact. Stone fought and lost to get that removed. Mueller Related GRU Case to Stone The Day After Barr’s Nomination Passed Committee Incidentally, Mueller added this 'related' designation to Stone’s case the day after the Senate Judiciary Committee waved Barr’s nomination through. Those [GRU] defendants then released many of the stolen documents, including through a website maintained by Organization 1. In the course of investigating that activity, the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and with Organization 1.Compare this paragraph defending that designation in Stone’s case to the criminal conduct charged to the GRU. This filing says search warrants were on dozens of accounts *in the GRU case* used for ‘transfer…. timing and promotion’. The GRU indictment says 'GRU officers …intentionally conspired …with persons known ..to the Grand Jury (collectively the 'Conspirators'),…steal documents… and stage releases' The FBI didn’t get search warrants linking the the GRU and Stone cases while investigating Stone. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 10, Summary: Louise Mensch argues that the Mueller Report provides evidence of a conspiracy between Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, and the GRU (Russian military intelligence) to hack the Democrats in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Mensch suggests that the GRU indictment and the indictment of Julian Assange show that WikiLeaks and Assange conspired with the GRU in the hacking itself, not just the publication of stolen materials. The article points to the connections between Roger Stone, WikiLeaks, and the GRU and argues that Mueller's plan is to file an indictment against WikiLeaks for colluding with the GRU's hack. The article is highly critical of Assange, WikiLeaks, and anyone involved in the alleged conspiracy. The language used and the emphasis on the alleged collusion between WikiLeaks and the GRU indicate a strong bias against Assange and WikiLeaks.\n"}
{"prompt":"The Supreme Court’s decision to effectively ban the consideration of race in college admissions reversed more than 40 years of precedent. It also left other kinds of admission preferences in place — ones that often benefit white students. For decades, the Court held that schools could consider race as one of many factors in the holistic review of an applicant, a consideration that could help foster diversity on campus. The majority opinion laid out how it worked. Harvard’s final stage of deciding to admit or reject students is a step called the 'lop,' in which four factors are evaluated: whether an applicant is a legacy, meaning an immediate family member went to Harvard; whether they were recruited as an athlete; whether they are eligible for financial aid; and their race. Race is now unconstitutional to consider, but other preferences remain. One study found that these preferences give an edge to white applicants. Among white students admitted to Harvard, 43 percent received a preference for athletics, legacy status, being on the dean’s interest list, or for being the child of a faculty or staff member, and without those advantages, three-quarters would have been rejected. Many colleges don’t have selective admissions at all. But at those that do, the Supreme Court, in other words, left plenty of discretion for college officials to fill their student bodies with the children of donors or employees, or with lacrosse, tennis, or football players, or with the children of alumni. Only the effort to create a racially diverse student body is now all but banned. While the Supreme Court left these preferences untouched, the Court’s decision is already renewing the debate over them. 'Well before the decision came down there have been conversations about what to do about the legacy boost, for example,' said Adam Nguyen, the founder of Ivy Link, an organization that advises families, who pay at least $150,000 beginning when their child is in middle school, on college admissions. 'People have long questioned why legacy even exists. In a democratic society, it seems intrinsically unfair that the children of alumni, generation after generation and by virtue of birth, get that privilege. These conversations are still sensitive but they shouldn’t be happening behind closed doors anymore.'Protests and lawsuits against 'affirmative action for white people' have already ensued. The advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Rights filed a complaint with the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights following the Supreme Court’s ruling, urging the department to investigate the legacy and donor admissions policies at Harvard, which they say discriminate against qualified Black, Hispanic, and Asian applicants in favor of less qualified white applicants. The complaint asked more than 1,500 colleges and universities to end legacy and donor preferences. 'There’s no birthright to Harvard. As the Supreme Court recently noted, ‘eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.’ There should be no way to identify who your parents are in the college application process,' said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights. 'Why are we rewarding children for privileges and advantages accrued by prior generations? Your family’s last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process.' Legacy status gives students a significant leg up Legacy students receive a boost during the admissions process because they are a family member of someone who attended the college — in some cases just parents; in others, grandparents, cousins, and even aunts and uncles count, too. Some schools draw a distinction between primary legacies, whose parents attended as undergraduates, and secondary legacies, a lesser preference for those whose parents attended as graduate students, Nguyen told Vox. Colleges say they use legacy admissions for a few reasons. One is to bolster their yield rates — the percentage of accepted students who choose to enroll, and a crucial number that admissions offices watch closely. Applying as a legacy student suggests that you’re more likely to attend if you get in.A bigger reason, though, is alumni engagement and funding. According to schools that consider legacy as a factor during holistic reviews, legacy students are more likely to stay connected to the college over generations and then are hence more likely to donate to the institution later on. (One study suggests the benefits to colleges might be overstated: Looking at data from 1998 to 2008, of the nation’s top 100 schools, 'there is no statistically significant evidence of a causal relationship between legacy preference policies and total alumni giving among top universities.') Schools that offer legacy preference say it is only one factor in an applicant’s profile. That means that legacy can boost an otherwise strong application, but doesn’t typically have the power to sway admissions officers to move a student from the 'no' to 'yes' pile on its own. Still, the difference between admission rates for legacy students and everyone else is striking. The Harvard v. Students for Fair Admissions case brought attention to the fact that between 2010 and 2015, the admission rate for legacy applicants at Harvard was higher than 33 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-legacies. More than 20 percent of white students admitted to Harvard during that period had legacy status. Of the nation’s top 100 universities in the U.S. News and World Report, about three-quarters use legacy preferences; virtually all of the nation’s top 100 liberal arts colleges do. Georgetown University’s 2024 class of 3,309 admitted applications is 9 percent legacy; Princeton’s 2025 class has 150 legacy students, 10 percent of the class; at Yale, it’s 14 percent. Stanford admitted just 4 percent of applicants to the class of 2023, but 16 percent of those admitted had a legacy background. Legacy admissions developed in the 1920s to discriminate against Jewish and Catholic applicants and favor Anglo-Protestant dominance. A century later, it still reinforces privilege: Underrepresented students of color make up 12.5 percent of applicants at selective colleges but only 6.7 percent of the legacy applicant pool. One study found that in Harvard’s class of 2019, 70 percent of legacy students were white and 41 percent of legacy admits had parents who earned more than $500,000 per year. At Princeton, 73 percent of legacy students in the class of 2023 are white. Criticism of legacy admissions is nothing new. ->","completion":" <Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The text discusses the Supreme Court's decision to ban race consideration in college admissions, while other admission preferences like legacy status and athletic recruitment remain.

{"prompt":"Chief Justice John Roberts ended his final opinion of the Supreme Court’s just-completed term by scolding his liberal colleagues. 'It has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,' Roberts wrote in response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Elena Kagan — which laid out in detail how Roberts and his fellow Republican appointees had just gone far beyond the proper role of the judiciary. Nor was Roberts the only justice this year who intimated that the justices’ rulings are beyond criticism. In an interview published by the Wall Street Journal in April, Justice Samuel Alito complained that the justices 'are being hammered daily' by critics, falsely claiming that this level of disparagement is 'new during my lifetime.' He also claimed that lawyers, the very people who are most educated about the courts and most capable of explaining their shortcomings, have a special obligation to defend his Court against criticism. One year after the Court’s GOP-appointed majority overruled Roe v. Wade, the same justices behind that decision remain emboldened, apparently eager to settle old scores, and openly disdainful of those who dare to question the wisdom of their rulings. At least two of them have accepted lavish gifts from billionaires, and are contemptuous of anyone who tells them it is wrong for powerful public servants to do so. It’s disturbing that two of the nine justices, who collectively have the final word on how to read the First Amendment, would even suggest that they should not be criticized. But it is not particularly surprising. Federal judges, who are not elected, must draw their legitimacy from the public perception that they are obedient to a legal text. Criticisms like the Kagan dissent Roberts responded so sharply to can refute that perception, and feed the rapidly growing disapproval of the Court.Similarly, disparagement of the justices and their decisions is one of the most powerful weapons ordinary Americans can wield against the nation’s nine justices. Indeed, if there is one lesson to be drawn from this Court’s recently completed term, it is to never underestimate the power of holding a grudge against the Supreme Court. The Court’s GOP-appointed majority is settling old grudges Until very recently — as in, less than 10 days ago — the right of universities to pay limited attention to race when admitting students was grounded in well-settled law. The Court first ruled that affirmative action is legal, albeit subject to significant constraints, in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978).The Court, moreover, reaffirmed Bakke in its 2003 decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. It did so again in 2013. And again in 2016. And yet, despite the fact that the Court had time and time again rejected efforts by racial conservatives like Edward Blum — the white activist behind many lawsuits challenging affirmative action — Blum and similarly minded advocates continued to hold a grudge. They were joined in holding onto that grudge by many of the justices themselves, and by powerful groups like the Federalist Society, which played an outsize role in selecting former President Donald Trump’s judicial nominees. The briefs in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, the case that the Court’s GOP-appointed majority used to end affirmative action at nearly all universities last month, raised few, if any, new legal arguments that weren’t heard before by the Court in Bakke. Nor has there been some triumphant victory over racism in the United States that eradicates the case for affirmative action. Though incomes and college graduation rates have risen for all racial groups within the United States since Bakke, the median Black household still earns at least $33,000 less in annual income than the median white household. No, the Supreme Court did not strike down affirmative action because of any change in the law. It struck it down because racial conservatives organized. They recruited powerful institutions like the Republican Party and the Federalist Society to their cause. And then they made a deal with the devil, as Trump-skeptical legal conservatives agreed to back his bid for the presidency in return for a small army of Federalist Society judges. Men like Ed Blum held a grudge. And they held onto it for decades. Until they won. This is, of course, the same story that played out in the last Supreme Court term, when the Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, and when it drastically expanded the rights of gun owners. Again, there were no important new insights in any of the briefs filed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) or in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022).Those cases were decided the way they were because abortion foes and gun rights advocates organized, took over the Republican Party, and held onto their grudges. They have nothing whatsoever to do with 'the law.' Lawyers’ grudges are the most powerful grudges of all There are, of course, mass movements against abortion, against affirmative action, and in support of expansive gun rights. Before racial conservatives convinced the Supreme Court to implement their college admissions policy preference from the bench, for instance, they successfully convinced voters to abolish affirmative action in many states. The same cannot be said about the Supreme Court’s 'major questions doctrine,' a legal rule largely invented by Republican appointees to the Supreme Court, which played a major role in the Biden v. Nebraska decision striking down the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program.That case asked whether a federal law known as the Heroes Act permits the US Department of Education to reduce many student borrowers’ loans — some by as much as $20,000. The correct answer to this question is 'yes,' as the Heroes Act gives the secretary of education sweeping authority to 'waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs ... as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.' And there’s no question that the Covid-19 pandemic, which inspired both the Trump and the Biden administrations to modify many student loan obligations, was such a 'national emergency.' The major questions doctrine, however, enables the Court to strike down programs, like Biden’s proposed loan relief under the Heroes Act, if a majority of the justices deem those programs too ambitious. As the Court has described this doctrine, it requires 'Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’' But this doctrine comes from nowhere at all. It is mentioned in no statute, and it certainly isn’t mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. As Justice Kagan has written, the major questions doctrine is nothing more than a 'get-out-of-text-free card,' frequently used to strike down programs that are authorized by the explicit text of a federal law, but that a majority of the justices don’t like. Yet, while the major questions doctrine cannot be found in the text of any law, it is easy to tell the doctrine’s origin story. And that story is one about very powerful lawyers who decided to hold onto a grudge. As recently as the Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush administrations, when Republicans controlled the executive branch — and with it the power to wield any authority delegated to federal agencies by Congress — many of America’s preeminent legal conservatives were staunch defenders of the idea that courts should defer to those agencies. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 7, Summary: The text criticizes Chief Justice John Roberts and the conservative justices of the Supreme Court, accusing them of going beyond the proper role of the judiciary and being disdainful of criticism.

{"prompt":"Though the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Friday to strike down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loans, student debt relief might still be happening, albeit a little slower than with the original plan. Speaking from the White House hours after the decision, the president announced his Plan B: to use the Higher Education Act, a 1965 law that governs most federal student loan programs, to provide the relief that the Court blocked. 'I’m announcing today a new path consistent with today’s ruling to provide student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible as quickly as possible,' Biden said. 'We will ground this new approach in a different law than my original plan, with the so-called Higher Education Act.' Biden also announced an alternative to the pause on student loan repayments that was scheduled to restart at the end of the summer: a temporary 12-month 'on-ramp' for repayment, from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, during which missed loan payments will not harm borrowers’ credit and the threat of default will be temporarily removed. Progressive activists and legal scholars have long argued that a separate pathway exists for justifying loan forgiveness, even after an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling. Advocates have long said the options are there for the Biden administration — if it moves quickly and forcefully.'We like to say that there’s a Swiss Army knife for canceling student debt — if they’ve taken away the tweezers, use the screwdriver; if someone takes your hammer, use a wrench,' Astra Taylor, a co-founder of the debtors union called the Debt Collective, told Vox in early June. 'There’s other ways to do this. Republicans have been terrible, very adversarial, but ultimately the Democrats and President Biden are not as powerless as they like to pretend they are.' The Biden administration remained quiet leading up to the Court’s decision, usually telling reporters it is confident that its plan will hold up in court. (The White House declined to comment before the decision was released.) But Biden seemed defiant in his address, saying, 'This new path is legally sound. It’s gonna take longer, and in my view it’s the best path that remains.'A possible Plan B for this kind of broad debt relief, meanwhile, isn’t totally new — it’s long been championed by the likes of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. It would involve resting the case for debt forgiveness on a broad provision of a law pertaining to higher education signed more than half a century ago. Whether it would withstand a court challenge is an open question, of course — but there’s only one way for the administration to find out. So what happens now? The first thing to understand about how broad student loan cancellation could happen again despite a Supreme Court ruling against the Biden plan is that different sources of legal authority exist for such a policy objective. The Biden administration’s current program depends on a specific provision in a post-9\/11 era law that gave the secretary of education the power to 'waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs' under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), which governs federal student loan programs. That law, known as the HEROES Act of 2003, gave the Education Department this specific 'waive or modify' authority to act for people on active duty or National Guard duty during a war, military operation, or national emergency; for people who lived or worked in a region affected by a national emergency; or for those who suffered an economic hardship from one of those crises. If the Court rejects the HEROES Act argument, the White House could invoke the HEA’s 'compromise and settlement' authority — a line in the 1965 law that advocates and legal scholars like Luke Herrine, an assistant professor of law at the University of Alabama, have argued gives the secretary of education broad authority to 'compromise, waive, or release’’ federal student debt. The HEA essentially established the foundations of the modern American college funding system (including grants, federal loans, and repayment plans), and gave the secretary of education the authority to collect debts. That power to collect debt, theoretically, means the department has the authority to forgive all that debt, too. The federal government has already invoked this power before to forgive debt through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — a debt repayment and forgiveness program for borrowers who work for a nonprofit or in public service in federal, state, tribal, or local government — and other income-based programs, as well as to settle cases with individual debtors, like the $6 billion settlement in Sweet v. Cardona, a class-action lawsuit in which borrowers claimed they were misled by mostly for-profit colleges. Those forms of settling and forgiving debt are 'the clear, unambiguous use case,' Herrine told Vox, since the government has already successfully invoked this compromise and settlement authority. 'But the statutory language doesn’t explicitly limit the authority in any way. So the question is, ‘If there aren’t these explicit limits, how do you understand what the limits on the authority are?’' The maximalist view is pretty simple: The authority given to the secretary of education is broad, and leaves at their discretion how to readjust or reprioritize debt collection and cancellation. How would Plan B work? Cancellation is possible even through a few narrower views of this executive authority, Herrine says, via two plausible justifications. The first involves the Education Department making the case that to properly continue to collect on debts going forward and avoid a cycle of defaults and outstanding unpaid debts once the repayment pause ends, the government would have to cancel a given amount of debt upfront and make it easier to collect on new debt. 'It’s a sort of short-term loss for a longer-term gain,' Herrine said. The other main justification comes from the fact that the Education Department has already notified at least 16 million people that they were eligible and approved for some kind of debt cancellation under the first Biden plan. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude: 2, Summary: The article discusses President Joe Biden's Plan B for student loan forgiveness after the Supreme Court struck down his original plan.

{"prompt":"President Joe Biden is enjoying the economic recovery of his dreams, complete with cooling inflation, a still-hot jobs market and diminishing odds of a recession. Now he just needs to figure out how to keep it that way.A White House that has bet Biden’s political future on the economy’s resilience — so much so that they’re branding it with the president’s name — got the latest encouraging sign Wednesday that its strategy is paying off, with new data showing a sharper than expected slowdown in consumer costs.The measure is a major reversal of fortune for Biden, after two years battling soaring inflation and accusations his agenda had contributed to the pain. But it’s just the latest in a string of economic developments that’s bolstered the administration’s confidence it can set the U.S. on a glide path without first plunging it into a downturn. 'Despite repeated forecasts that recession is just around the corner, the U.S. recovery is solid,' National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York shortly after the inflation data came out Wednesday. 'The economy is defying predictions that inflation would not fall absent significant job destruction.' Yet even as fears of a disastrous recession fade, Biden and his allies are already turning their attention toward a range of smaller obstacles that threaten to dampen the White House’s political narrative. There remains a wariness within the ranks that taking a full victory lap on the economy could invite political troubles down the road — and that the administration lacks the tools to deal with a serious setback should one occur between now and the election in 16 months. 'Good news is good news for the White House at this point,' said Tobin Marcus, a former economic adviser to Biden. 'It doesn’t rule out the possibility that things do go rougher than they hope.' The administration is bracing for the mass resumption of student loan payments this fall, which could send a financial shock through millions of households that have benefited from the three-year reprieve. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are already signaling plans to wage a budget battle likely to shut down the government and further shake the nation’s political stability. And then there’s the Federal Reserve, which remains determined to hike interest rates in pursuit of lowering inflation to 2 percent, despite warnings it could end up tipping the U.S. into recession.'Do we want to sacrifice the economy to the altar of the 2 percent inflation rate?' Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said earlier this week. On Wednesday, he tweeted that the latest inflation report served as more reason to 'rethink' the Fed’s strategy. Biden allies insist those are each manageable elements on their own. But the White House is already struggling to convince Americans that the economy is, in fact, good at a time when all the major indicators are moving in the right direction. And together, those looming hurdles represent a reminder that Biden and his team can only exercise so much control over the economy’s path in the run-up to 2024. 'There’s going to be cooling because economies just cool down — they can’t grow endlessly,' said one economic adviser to the White House, who was granted anonymity to speak freely. 'The only thing I worry about is the shock that I can’t predict.' Biden himself has shown some restraint in how he frames the economic recovery, even amid an extended road tour to claim credit for strengthening conditions across the country. In an otherwise triumphant June speech meant to formally outline his Bidenomics agenda, Biden closed by cautioning, 'I’m not here to declare victory.' He repeated the disclaimer in South Carolina last week, warning that 'we have a lot more work to do.' Inside the administration, aides described their focus more on alleviating voters’ existing misgivings about the state of the economy rather than promising a rosy future. The White House has long harbored deep frustrations with media coverage that officials view as obsessed with the threat of recession, even as the underlying data showed consistent signs of strength — a dynamic they blame in part for the public’s dim view of how Biden has handled the economy.'We have heard doomsayers saying a recession is around the corner for more than a year,' said one White House official, who was granted anonymity to describe the outlook inside the building. 'Obviously, there will always be bumps on the road, but we have dealt with unexpected bumps and our economic recovery has powered through.' The administration has sought to smooth out some of the impending bumps that it can predict. After the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s bid to cancel billions of dollars in student debt, the White House rolled out a new strategy that will ease repayment penalties for financially vulnerable borrowers over the next year. The 'on ramp' policy won’t avert the anticipated drop in borrowers’ spending that could ripple through the economy and slow its progress. But it could help spread some of the impact over several months, rather than having it hit all at once. 'The hardship for households in some cases is going to be very real,' Marcus said. 'Macroeconomically, I don’t see that being the thing that tips us into recession.' Biden has also begun taking aim at individual Republicans over economic issues. Having navigated a potentially disastrous debt ceiling showdown, he is now moving to insulate himself from the political fallout of a potential government shutdown. In particular, the White House has been highlighting GOP lawmakers who opposed his policies — even as they tout the ways in which their districts have benefited from them.But beyond that bully pulpit, Biden has few major levers remaining to stabilize the economy if it falters more significantly, especially as much of the pandemic aid that proved a critical financial cushion over the last few years expires. Though the White House has steered clear of commenting on the Fed, aides and allies have kept close watch on a rate-hiking campaign many privately worry will go too far in its bid to lower inflation.There’s also some trepidation over how much longer the economy can keep up its pace, and whether even small signs of cooling around this time next year could unravel all the work officials are doing now to sell voters on Biden’s economic record. But for now, Biden has navigated through two years of pitfalls and emerged with a strengthening economy in hand. Voters may say they don’t yet feel it. Still, it’s a frame the White House is increasingly willing to embrace — for as long as it lasts. 'The story of almost every recession in modern American history is something bad happened, and it was something bad we didn’t see coming,' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. 'What could happen between now and 2024? A shit-ton of bad things. You know what else could happen? Good things.' ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 0, Summary: The article discusses President Joe Biden's positive economic recovery and diminishing inflation, highlighting the administration's confidence in sustaining it.

{"prompt":"The year is 2033. A Donald Trump hologram is president. The Republicans are in control of Congress and the White House. The Supreme Court has just two liberal votes. And it’s now illegal to make a white person feel even slightly uncomfortable. After we exhausted the Greek alphabet for new COVID-19 variants, a new pandemic dubbed COVID-26 has killed scores of people around the globe. Frustrated that Black people can technically still vote (even though it has become nearly impossible), thousands of white people stormed the U.S. Capitol to demand martial law — but only in cities that did not vote for Hologram Trump. The military obliged. The campaign to discredit any teachers who spoke about racism was wildly successful and actual history has been banned from all schools in the United States under the auspices of removing critical race theory. The following is an excerpt from an educator’s brief overview of a U.S. history class in our now-CRT-free America. I am happy to announce, on behalf of nice white parents everywhere, that education in this country is finally back on track. After completely giving up on trying to mitigate COVID-26, teachers and staffers alike are so grateful to be together, all 62 students per teacher, in cozy classrooms unmasked and unbothered.You may have some burning questions such as what is critical race theory? And how exactly was it previously being taught to our country’s kindergarteners? While those are important questions, we’re not going to address them. What we will address is that all across the country, white third graders were being taught to hate themselves because of slavery even though it was so long ago that literally no one is affected by it today. But don’t worry: After Republican governors in Florida and Virginia banned critical race theory from ever being taught in our schools in 2022, it caught on nationwide and now no child anywhere will even have to learn about the transatlantic slave trade. In fact, we can’t even call it a slave trade, so from here on out, they will be referred to as 'low-skilled laborers with dark skin.' How did we get here, you ask? Back in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and officer-involved killings had certain people convinced that America was a racist country. They taught children that the policies and laws undergirding our society were based on racist ideals. Shocking, right? White people, even the ones who didn’t cause any killings, felt personally attacked — so they fought back. They united in their efforts to ban books and fire any educator who dared to try and tarnish America’s good name.Well, now we finally have people like Vice President Marjorie Taylor Greene and Sen. Candace Owens (their interracial friendship proves that racism hardly exists) to set the record straight and get our children back on track. Racism is rare, brief and never systematic; you can’t prove it because you can never know what’s truly in a man’s heart. Before the crackdown on critical race theory, you may have heard that the founding of this country was not on the up and up. Those people, however, only wanted to make white people feel bad. The truth is the Founding Fathers — who are infallible, by the way — wrote a perfect document. You may be wondering why it has so many amendments if it’s so perfect. And to that I say, that wasn’t a very patriotic question. Who cares if sla — er, I mean low-skilled laborers were only three-fifths of a person? What matters is that was a very long time ago and their descendants are five-fifths now. The country only descended into a civil war in 1861 because southern states were worried about their economy. You see, those low-skilled laborers were very helpful when it came to making white people richer. And they were fighting for states’ rights! But it all worked out in the end because the South lost the war. There certainly wasn’t a campaign to violently overthrow any state governments that attempted to build a multiracial democracy in the aftermath. And there definitely weren’t any laws or policies created to prevent the low-skilled laborers from living as free people and gaining access to land ownership or quality education. In fact, nobody is really sure how things got to be so unequal. It certainly wasn’t because of white supremacist policies or racial segregation — that would imply something divisive or uncomfortable. So we’ll just say those descendants did it to themselves.OK, maybe there was a tiny bit of racism. But this part of history has a happy ending! Perhaps you’ve heard of the civil rights movement? In the 1960s, the descendants of those low-skilled laborers were upset that they didn’t seem to have the same rights as their fair-skinned counterparts. They participated in marches and protests, but really, everyone — especially moderate white people — were on their side. The most important takeaway from this obviously brief and unfortunate period of racism is that it’s over. Martin Luther King Jr., who coincidentally died young but definitely not because of his skin color or his beliefs, gave a beautiful speech at the Washington Monument. He had a dream that your kids would stop being judged for the crime of being white. Isn’t that beautiful? That one speech singularly ended the very brief racism the United States experienced. We’ve been living in racial harmony ever since. It’s just a coincidence that as soon as a Black person was elected president of the United States way back in 2008, your dear old Uncle Mitchell — who was never really interested in politics — started watching Fox News every night and complaining about the Blacks. After all, Barack Obama was only interested in dividing our country. And that time your Black co-worker was late to work because they had to drive 50 miles away from home just to cast a ballot on Election Day? Well, that was just poor planning on their part. Maybe they should’ve lived in a different neighborhood. And shouldn’t they have been more grateful that legally they can still vote? It probably won’t stay that way for much longer.I know the latest insurrection at the Capitol was perhaps a little bit violent, but let’s give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were fighting for states’ rights. Or maybe it was just economic anxiety. The takeaway from this lesson is that nothing that’s happened in the past is relevant to today. I only talk about history so you can see how far we’ve come as a country. All of the problems those bad teachers were telling kids about — privilege, racism, inequality — that was just an attempt to brainwash our children. How can white people have privilege if I’ve seen a homeless white person before and Black celebrities have millions of dollars? They claim racism, and yet every February, we allow each corporation to pander to Black people about how racism is actually over. (By the way, if you hear any teachers use the word 'racism' or 'privilege,' be sure to call the National Combating Critical Race Theory tip line. Please do NOT spam it with prank calls.) The most important thing we want to factor in when teaching our children about American history is the comfort of white people. Before our new leaders took over, teachers could say abhorrent things about this country like 'it’s a racist dumpster fire' or 'it’s a musty place that not even aliens would invade.' But now, thanks to the God-fearing, country-loving Republicans, our children can remain safe and warm in their cocoons — never forced to challenge their worldview or even consider for a moment that America isn’t a sparkling democracy. White parents can sleep soundly at night knowing their children will never experience the pain of finding out about topics that may make them slightly uncomfortable. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 10, Summary: The text is a satirical piece written from a strongly left-leaning perspective.

{"prompt":"Alarm about critical race theory—a previously obscure field of study pioneered by far-left legal scholars and sociologists—has suddenly gripped the political right. This development has forced the right's adversaries on Team Blue to defend a theory that very few people on either side of this increasingly silly debate could accurately define if challenged to do so. At least Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley was honest. Last week, under intense grilling by House Republicans, he conceded that he would 'have to get much smarter on whatever the theory is.' Nevertheless, he thought there was certainly a place for it in university classrooms; after all, students of history study communism and fascism, not because those were good ideas, but because it's important to learn why they failed. 'The United States Military Academy is a university,' said Milley. 'It is important that we train and we understand. I want to understand white rage, and I'm white. And I want to understand it.' In response, the conservative writer J.D. Vance quipped that U.S. generals should read less about 'white rage' and more about 'not losing wars.' It's a troll-ish response that captures so much of what is wrong with the current public meltdown about critical race theory (CRT): Practically no one agrees on—or even appears to understand—what CRT is and how far it has spread. So let's just get this out of the way: Critical race theory is the idea that structural racism is embedded in many U.S. institutions. Slavery was the reality when the country was founded, and segregation endured for a century following the Civil War. It would thus be naive to assume that supposedly race-neutral policies are actually race-neutral—there's nothing neutral about America and race. Working from this assumption, adherents of critical race theory tend toward a kind of progressive activism that views post-Enlightenment classical liberalism and its notions of equal opportunity, the prioritization of individual rights over group rights, and colorblindness with hostility. Since very few people involved in the CRT debate have had much experience with the above definition, nearly everybody who has waded into this controversy is right about some things and wrong about many other things. Savvier liberals are correct, for instance, that CRT, as defined by the people who actually coined the term, mostly exists in academia, not K-12 classrooms. This means that Republican legislative efforts to protect kids from CRT are actually targeting a wide swath of only semi-related progressive concepts. These bills are almost uniformly heavy-handed, and in some cases represent active threats to freedom of expression in the classroom. Pennsylvania's anti-CRT bill, for instance, would prohibit university professors from teaching any 'racist or sexist concept' or bringing an outside speaker to campus who does the same. Remember when conservatives were outraged about the disinvitation campaigns waged against campus speakers like Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos? Well, this bill would make disinvitation the law of the land. University bureaucrats would have to scroll through prospective speakers' Twitter feeds, on the hunt for statements that could be read as racist or sexist. (This would obviously not benefit socially conservative speakers, many of whom do, after all, believe that there are differences between men and women and different roles for them in society.) At the same time, anti-CRT folks on the right are correct that there are a whole host of progressive writers, teachers, and activists who were clearly inspired by critical race theory—a field that does in fact include fairly radical ideas, some of which run contrary to the colorblind liberalism of previous racial equality advocacy. Whether or not these people would admit to being adherents of CRT is almost beside the point. Included in this mix are two of the least persuasive anti-racism writers: White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo and How to Be Antiracist author Ibram X. Kendi, who are routinely paid thousands of dollars to give short presentations to corporate employees, school administrators, and teachers. Both take wildly flawed approaches; DiAngelo treats racism as a kind of incurable infection, or original sin—John McWhorter accurately accused her of promoting the cultish notion that 'you will never succeed in the 'work' she demands of you…it is lifelong, and you will die a racist just as you will die a sinner.' Kendi's big idea is to create a U.S. Department of Antiracism. 'The DOA would be responsible for preclearing all local, state and federal public policies to ensure they won't yield racial inequity, monitor those policies, investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces, and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas,' he wrote. This proposal would necessitate the creation of a vast surveillance state and render the First Amendment moot. Now that critical race theory is under attack, Kendi has denied being an adherent of it, saying in a statement, 'I don't identify as a critical race theorist.' MSNBC host Joy Reid used this as a gotcha moment during a segment with Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the foremost anti-CRT activist. But this is semantics: Kendi also told Slate that CRT was 'foundational' to his work: I've certainly been inspired by my critical race theory and critical race theorists, the way in which I've formulated definitions of racism and racist and anti-racism and Antiracist have not only been based on historical sort of evidence, but also Kimberle Crenshaw intersectional theory, which is she's one of the founding and pioneering critical race theorists who in the late 1980s and early 1990s said, you know what, black women aren't just facing racism. They're not just facing sexism. They're facing the intersection of racism and sexism. And it's important for us to understand that. And that's foundational to my work. The Department of Antiracism is not an idea that comes to us explicitly from CRT literature, but the man who proposed it views CRT as inexorably tied with his antiracism work. It is thus not entirely unfair for conservatives to use CRT as shorthand for the sorts of things to which they object. The person most responsible for this framing—CRT as the avatar of all dubious race and diversity stuff—is undoubtedly Rufo, whose unmatched zeal for exposing it occasionally makes him sound like the sort of activist he is otherwise criticizing. He tweeted, for instance, 'The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory.'  ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 4, Summary: The text provides a nuanced perspective on the debate surrounding critical race theory (CRT).

{"prompt":"During the 2020 fall semester, Kali Fontanilla—a high school English language teacher working in the Salinas, California, school district—noticed that many of her students were failing one of their other classes: ethnic studies. This was at the height of the pandemic, and instruction was entirely online, leaving many students in the lurch. Still, Fontanilla thought it was odd to see so many Fs. Salinas has a majority Mexican population; all of Fontanilla's students were Hispanic and were learning English as a second language. Education officials who propose adding ethnic studies to various curriculums—and making it mandatory, as the Salinas school district did—typically intend for privileged white students to learn about other cultures. There's a certain irony in requiring members of an ethnic minority to study this, and an even greater irony in the fact that such students were struggling intensely with the course. 'My students are failing ethnic studies,' says Fontanilla, who is of Jamaican ancestry. 'I would say half of them are failing this ethnic studies class.' This made Fontanilla curious about what the course was teaching. All of the high school's teachers used the same online platform to post lesson plans and course materials, so Fontanilla decided to take a look. She was shocked by what she saw. 'This was like extreme left brainwashing of these kids,' says Fontanilla. 'Critical race theory all throughout the lessons, from start to finish. The whole thing.' Critical race theory, or CRT, has become a flashpoint in the debate about what kids ought to be learning in public schools. Originally an obscure, left-wing body of thought that mostly appeared in graduate schools, critics charge it with influencing diversity workshops for major corporations, training seminars for teachers, and even K-12 curricula. Parental concerns about CRT became a major flashpoint in the 2022 Virginia gubernatorial race. After winning the race and taking office, Republican challenger Glenn Youngkin's first act was to ban CRT. Many adherents of CRT deny that it's taught to primary education students, and the mainstream media have been quick to line up behind such claims. That's why Fontanilla's discovery was so significant. 'The teacher had the kids all learn about the four I's of oppression,' says Fontanilla. The four I's were institutional, internalized, ideological, and interpersonal oppression. 'And then there was a whole presentation on critical race theory and they actually had the students analyze the school through critical race theory.' Slides from lesson plans provided by Fontanilla confirm that the ethnic studies course references critical race theory by name.The original meaning of the theory, at least when taught at the college level, is that racism so pervades U.S. society and U.S. institutions that it is impossible to separate race from other issues: All policies, structures, and laws were built under the auspices of racism, a sort of original sin that shapes the country's institutions. In common parlance, opponents often use the term 'CRT' to refer a broader set of concepts, like intersectionality—the idea that there are different kinds of oppression that all stack on top of each other—and privilege. 'The kids don't even want this stuff,' says Fontanilla, noting that the ethnic studies course replaced a much more popular health class—in the midst of a pandemic, no less. 'Most of them are just like, 'Why do we have to take this class?'' They would have to direct that question to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state's Democratic-controlled legislature, which decided to mandate ethnic studies for all public schools. Newsom vetoed a previous mandate, which came under fire because the proposed curriculum included 'jargon such as 'cisheteropatriarchy' and 'hxrstory,' and refers to capitalism as a form of power and oppression alongside white supremacy and racism,' according to Cal Matters. The legislature re-worked the ethnic studies proposal, and on October 8, 2021, Newsom signed the mandate into law. Beginning with the class of 2030, all public high school students in California will now have enroll in the same sort of course that Fontanilla's students already took. In a statement to The Epoch Times, Dan Burns, superintendent of Salinas Union High School district, denied that the course was based on CRT, though he conceded that CRT 'is addressed in our course as one of the frameworks within the K-12 Ethnic Studies Outcomes list.' Indeed, CRT is referenced in the district's ethnic course syllabus, which is available online. The syllabus stresses that students will study 'intergenerational trauma' through an interdisciplinary and critical lens. Scholarly articles about critical race theory are included in the suggested curriculum, including 'Whose culture has capital? A critical race theory discussion of community cultural wealth,' by Tara J. Yosso, a UCLA professor of education who specializes in critical race theory. One of suggested activities for students is an 'intersectional rainbow.' 'Students will rank their various identities with corresponding colored strings to create intersectional rainbows. Gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, beliefs, nationality, ability, age, etc.,' reads the syllabus. 'Students will compare and contrast their intersectional rainbows with their peers, while framing their discourse within the intersectionality paradigm as laid out by Kimberlé Crenshaw.' Crenshaw, a Columbia University law professor, is widely recognized as one of CRT's founding figures. (Vanity Fair once called her the 'mastermind of critical race theory.') Other possible classroom activities include hosting a mock trial where they accuse various historical persons of being complicit in the genocide of Native Californians and 'creating a social justice oriented counter-narrative.' Salina's version of the course included a 'privilege quiz': Students were expected to rank themselves based on their marginalized status or lack thereof. The lesson plan included an image of two white girls—former Republican President George W. Bush's twin daughters, to be precise—at the top of the privilege hierarchy. 'Some people are born in third base and think they hit a triple,' says Fontanilla, recalling the intended message of the exercise. 'So basically, they were born on third base and they graduated college because they had a head start.' Many people might consider such activities to be a form of left-wing activism infiltrating the classroom . Fontanilla is one of them. As a Christian, a conservative, and a black woman, she doesn't believe that students—especially her students, learning English as a second language—need to be taught to check their privilege. 'It's hyper-race-focused,' says Fontanilla. 'And whenever there's hyper race focus, racism will follow.' Fontanilla decided that district parents had a right to know what was in the curriculum, and took steps to obtain the lesson plans so that she her job would not be at risk if she leaked them. But when the district handed over the documents, it omitted the slides that included the words critical race theory. She decided to write a letter to the school board in protest of the ethnic studies curriculum. It was read aloud at a meeting on June 22. 'I do not appreciate constantly being pandered to and treated differently because of the color of my skin, especially since I did not have the freedom to not go along with it,' Fontanilla wrote, warning that the curriculum was an attempt at left-wing indoctrination. The statement elicited cheers from other parents attending the meeting. In response, the school board prohibited anti-CRT comments at its next public gathering. 'You know it's something evil when they get so nasty defending it,' says Fontanilla. While she has received much praise for speaking out, Fontanilla has also endured considerable online harassment, including threats of violence. One told her to 'have fun being a token black friend to racist conservatives your whole life.' 'They're all basically white liberals,' she says of the harassers. Fontanilla had already decided that she could not remain a teacher in the school district; she and her husband decided to move to Florida, where she hoped to find a better job. The twin experiences of remote instruction during the pandemic and race-focused education has left her feeling cold about the teaching profession. She recalls that during the summer of 2020, in the midst of the George Floyd protests, the Salinas administration informed its black teachers—Fontanilla included—that they would be honored with a gift. The gift, it turned out, was a mask bearing the message: Black Teachers Matter. 'I would never wear it in front of my students,' she says. 'I think especially if a kid isn't into Black Lives Matter and I'm wearing this Black Teachers Matter mask, that kid automatically knows they can't speak up in my class.' The gift also included an 'I Love Being Black' sticker, and a letter with an ancient African greeting that 'acknowledges the god in me and stuff like that.' 'It was just so weird,' she says. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 7, Summary: The article discusses the experience of a high school teacher, Kali Fontanilla, who discovered critical race theory (CRT) being taught in an ethnic studies course in the Salinas school district.

{"prompt":"he Washington Post on Wednesday examined the silliest goddamn thing I've ever seen taking place within the federal budget process, which is something like a corn maze on its best days. The Republicans are trying to jam all their favorite culture war gimcracks into the National Defense Authorization Act. In response, Kevin McCarthy is Kevin McCarthy-ing all over the place, trying to keep the angry children away from the cutlery. The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act includes increased investment in precision missiles, warships and newer technologies like artificial intelligence and hypersonics — core bipartisan priorities as the Pentagon directs greater attention toward China. It also authorizes a 5.2 percent base pay increase for military personnel and expanded support for their families through housing improvements, and broader access to child care, health care and education benefits. OK, that's fairly conventional stuff right down to what I am sure are going to be substantial cost overruns on most of the technology. But the arena for debate has taken a turn into the absurd. The Republicans are attempting to DeSantisize the U.S. military. But it is the country’s intensifying culture-war battles, not any specific approach to U.S. national security, likely to attract the most vociferous debate as lawmakers consider amendments to the bill in the coming days.

Oddly enough, it began this time in the Senate with Senator Tommy Tuberville's preposterous hold on important military promotions.

{"prompt":"While Americans enjoy remarkable freedom to exercise their faith, courts and legislators are struggling with how to balance competing rights claims. Politicians and the media regularly offer histrionic sound-bites that feed into the culture wars and promote a false dichotomy between protecting religious liberty on the one hand and guaranteeing equality and other fundamental rights on the other. It is not uncommon to hear the argument that according religion any kind of recognition or special treatment is nothing short of an unconstitutional establishment and\/or a form of discrimination against the non-religious. These arguments have practical ramifications on the daily lives of millions, affecting everything from school choice and voucher programs, to regulations on faith-based foster care and adoption services, to contraception\/abortion mandates, to the business decisions of closely held corporations. The place of religion in public life will also undoubtedly continue to play a large role in future elections. Some arguments cannot be resolved and are destined to remain intractably partisan right-left issues. The protection of religion however, enshrined in the dual religion clauses of our First Amendment (no establishment and free exercise), should not be one of them. As an Orthodox rabbi, I absolutely believe that religion is important for its own sake. But instead of trying to explain why religion is special (status), an impossible theological feat in a post-religious world, both our legal and our public relations efforts should focus on how religion is and has been demonstrably beneficial to everyone, including the non-religious (its use). If religion is beneficial to society at large, then treating it benevolently is nothing more than a neutral acknowledgment and appreciation for a particular medium that consistently and demonstrably provides a host of secular goods on a neutral and non-discriminatory basis. Given that premise, government support for religious education would be much less controversial, a permissible and practical way of supporting activities that lead to public benefit. Thankfully, the research here is undeniably telling. Numerous studies have confirmed that religious Americans are generally more altruistic neighbors and more conscientious citizens than their non-religious counterparts. As Harvard (an institution originally founded as a Christian seminary I might add) sociologist Robert Putnam describes in his masterpiece 'American Grace' (which was based on two of the most comprehensive surveys ever conducted on religion and public life in America), holding constant for all other demographic factors, involvement in religious organizations and religious networks remains one of the strongest predictors of philanthropic generosity, civic involvement, and community leadership that we have available. Demonstrably then, religion does provide certain quantifiable secular goods for the broader American society, which is why it can sometimes be granted special treatment without violating anti-establishment norms. Second, from a free exercise perspective, we must have faith in and make use of the existing legal system. It has been nine years since the Supreme Court released its decision in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby, which held that for-profit corporations can refuse to provide certain contraceptive services in health plans offered to employees, on the grounds that doing so would violate the owners’ particular Christian beliefs. In order to move past the current tensions, the leaders of the broader faith community must reframe the argument and reset the national conversation – because if not them, then who? From a legal perspective, this is a two-step process involving both establishment and free exercise concerns. First, the religious community must focus on speaking in a language that everyone can understand – even those secularists who disagree with our assumptions. As an Orthodox rabbi, I absolutely believe that religion is important for its own sake.

If you read most of the breathless articles published in the months leading up to the decision, you would have gotten the sense that a win for Hobby Lobby would allow religious groups a pass to do anything they want, and turn America into a theocracy. Well, Hobby Lobby did win, and American democracy is doing just fine. That's because strict scrutiny as a framework for dealing with competing rights claims actually works, and its narrow, case-specific application does not feed into culture war dynamics.Under federal law, if there is a sincerely held religious belief at play, and there is a law that would create a substantial burden on that belief, the court asks if the government has a compelling interest in enforcing that law to the detriment of said belief – or (as in the case of Hobby Lobby) if there is perhaps some other way to make sure that everyone can get what it is that they need. All Hobby Lobby proved was that even in the most contentious cases there often is another way. Politicians don’t need to invent a new balancing test for religious liberty; we have one and it works.And so, if the religious community wishes to succeed in winning minds and not just cases (and even after a win, to avoid the prospect of being back before the court every time its ideological leaning shifts), we must make it clear that there is no 'us' versus 'them' here. All that framework does is further divide our fractured society by creating 'winners' and 'losers,' instead of clarifying what it means to live in, and appreciate, diversity. Respect for religious beliefs can be, should be, and has been effectively balanced with other rights. And the exercise of religion is a good thing, even at the secular level. It should be appreciated for God’s sake – but also, demonstrably for everyone else’s sake too. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 6, Summary: The article argues that the debate surrounding religion and its role in society should move beyond the false dichotomy between protecting religious liberty and guaranteeing equality.

{"prompt":"AI's breakthrough into popular culture, marked by chatbot tools like ChatGPT, has turned this technology into a battleground for culture warriors. However, equating artificial intelligence or AI with social media platforms could cost us significant advances in healthcare, transportation and global leadership in technology. Over the past decade, politicians have developed a playbook for scoring political points by criticizing social media. Democrats have focused on the spread of misinformation and disinformation, while Republicans have raised concerns about perceived bias against conservative views. Both sides seek to 'work the refs' to weaponize social media platforms against their political opponents. When ChatGPT was first released, culture warriors mobilized, competing with each other to trick the bot into misbehaving. Critics on the right have claimed that it has a liberal bias. One user asked ChatGPT to create a poem admiring Donald Trump; the bot refused, yet was able to create a poem praising President Biden.  On the other hand, ChatGPT has also been accused by those on the left of being biased against minorities, sexist and non-inclusive. For example, one researcher asked ChatGPT how one might identify good scientists given only demographic information. The bot’s response was to screen for white males. In many of these cases, ChatGPT results say more about the person asking the question than it does about the underlying machine learning. It is a tool that strings together patterns of words that make sense statistically, but may or may not make sense logically or factually. AI chatbots riff. They do not reflect. But all this is missing the point: ChatGPT is AI, but all AI is not ChatGPT. In fact, most AI is not ChatGPT. And AI and ChatGPT are not social media. Trying to simplify it all into one categorically 'dangerous' technology will stifle our economy and halt innovation.  Congress has yet to get that understanding. In May of this year, the Senate Judiciary Committee hosted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and others in the first big AI hearing since the release of ChatGPT. And congress brought its social media playbook. Sen. Judiciary Chair Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, in his opening remarks expressed concerns about 'weaponized disinformation, housing discrimination, the harassment of women and impersonation fraud, voice cloning, and deep fakes.' and noted that Congress 'had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment.' Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley worried about election manipulation and targeted advertising business models driving tech addiction. Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin built on Blumenthal’s parallels to social media by criticizing the liability regime around social media platforms and asking how AI companies should be liable for how their tools are used. Others raised issues of intellectual property, election misinformation, privacy and data security. All issues that Congress has raised over the years about social media. AI is not another social media platform, and it is much bigger than the AI chatbots that have made such a splash. ChatGPT uses recent breakthrough technologies to identify a web of patterns in human language, and then applies that understanding to create a chat-like interface. But the underlying machine learning technology that facilitates automatic pattern recognition given large amounts of raw data is already in widespread use. In fact, similar tech already powers the voice recognition and text dictation such as that used by Alexa devices and Siri or the face-recognition technology that you use to unlock your iPhone. More powerful versions of those techniques are delivering huge benefits in medical imaging, drug discovery, accident collision and traffic management, personalized education and more.  Regulating AI to deal with the risks of chatbots is like regulating all uses of metal to deal with car accidents.  That's why we need a sector-specific, application-focused approach to AI. Just as we have different rules for steel hammers, titanium hip replacements, iron girders and aluminum planes, our rules for AI ought to focus on the applications. We already have piles of rules for many different industries where AI will be applied. Government should identify what rules already apply to specific AI applications. If there are gaps, those should be filled. And importantly, if there are existing rules that are unnecessarily preventing the use of AI in an industry or application, this should be revised or removed. This is difficult, lower-profile work. But it is crucial for maximizing AI’s benefits. If culture warriors continue to conscript AI companies into the culture war, we risk losing sight of the broader societal benefits that AI offers. The price of waging this culture war would be missing the much bigger opportunity to help everyone live safer, healthier, more productive lives. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 3, Summary: The article discusses the tendency of culture warriors to equate artificial intelligence (AI) with social media platforms and highlights the potential negative consequences of this oversimplification.

{"prompt":"TALLAHASSEE — When Gov. Ron DeSantis thrust himself into the national immigration debate earlier this year, he used taxpayer funds to relocate nearly 50 Venezuelan migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard. The DeSantis administration chartered two planes on Sept. 14 from San Antonio, Texas, with stops in Crestview, Florida, before heading to their destination in Massachusetts. It has to-date spent more than $1.5 million on its migrant relocation program. DeSantis, who did not alert authorities in Martha’s Vineyard or Massachusetts, said the flights were part of a $12 million Florida program to transport undocumented immigrants to so-called sanctuary destinations and to protest President Biden’s 'reckless' border security policies. Other state governors, mainly Gregg Abbott of Texas, also sent migrants to other cities, including New York, Chicago and Washington D.C., where some were dropped off outside the home of Vice President Kamala Harris as recently as Christmas Eve.'Our message to them is we are not a sanctuary state, and it's better to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction,' said DeSantis after the planes with Venezuelans were flown to Martha's Vineyard. 'And yes, we will help facilitate that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures.' The action by DeSantis drew indignation from President Biden to officials in Massachusetts, along with immigrant advocates, who called the flights 'a political stunt' and that the migrants were used 'as political pawns.'Most of the migrants received humanitarian parole after entering the U.S. and plan to apply for asylum, meaning they are not undocumented, lawyers representing the migrants told reporters. The Venezuelans are now awaiting decisions on their asylum petitions in U.S. immigration court, a process that could take months or even years. Immigration lawyers representing the Venezuelans said they were given a brochure by a woman named 'Perla' before leaving Texas that outlined assistance with housing, cash and other support if they chose to be taken to Massachusetts. The New York Times identified the woman as 'Perla Huerta,' a former combat medic and counterintelligence agent who was recently discharged after two decades in the U.S. Army. Efforts to reach her by various media outlets, including the USA Today Network-Florida, have been unsuccessful.DeSantis denied claims of immigrant advocates and others that the migrants were duped into taking the flights with promises of jobs that did not exist. Nearly four months after the controversial migrant flights, DeSantis and other administration officials face a legal gauntlet in state and federal court. There’s also a criminal investigation in Texas in connection with the recruitment of the migrants for the flights to Massachusetts. Here’s a look at the latest legal battles facing the DeSantis administration and those reportedly involved in the migrant relocation program. Migrants file suit for 'fraudulent scheme' A federal class action lawsuit was filed in Boston on behalf of the migrants that accuses the DeSantis administration of deploying a 'fraudulent and discriminatory scheme' to transport them. That litigation continues. The Boston-based Lawyers for Civil Rights, which filed the suit, alleges that Florida and Vertol officials transported the migrants under false pretenses. [The migrants] were destitute and had arrived in a foreign country without employment prospects or supportive resources,' the lawyers wrote. '[They] were particularly vulnerable and susceptible to Defendants’ false promises.'State Senator: DeSantis wrongly spends migrant relocation dollars Democratic Florida state senator filed suit to stop DeSantis from using more funds from the migrant relocation program. A Leon County judge dismissed the lawsuit in November, telling state Sen. Jason Pizzo, D-Miami, the case could proceed if he amended his complaint. He did just that, and the litigation continues, with hearings scheduled in the New Year. Pizzo alleges that the way the money has been used is counter to state law, such as by not having a proper bidding process and failing to meet the requirements set by the Florida Legislature to only transport 'unauthorized aliens' from within the state. He also states the program itself is unconstitutional, claiming it shouldn’t have been created in a budget bill. The criminal probe in San Antonio, Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar of Bexar County, Texas, announced in September that his agency had opened an investigation into how 48 Venezuelan migrants were 'lured' to board flights from San Antonio to Martha's Vineyard. His spokesperson did not immediately respond to a USA Today Network-Florida reporter email and voicemail about the status of the investigation.In October, Salazar declared that the migrants were victims of a crime. 'Based upon the claims of migrants being transported from Bexar County under false pretenses, we are investigating this case as possible Unlawful Restraint,' he said in a statement. This declaration creates the possibility for the migrants to get a special visa to remain in the United States.Federal treasury investigates use of funds The Treasury's Office of the Inspector General said it is examining whether Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis improperly used COVID-19 aid to fund the transport of 50 migrants from Texas to Massachusetts. Treasury officials did not respond immediately on the examination’s status. The Florida Legislature boosted an $8 million request earlier this year by DeSantis for the migrant relocation program to $12 million to be administered by the state Department of Transportation. The $12 million comes from interest earnings from Florida’s $8.8 billion portion of the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan. OIG officials said the probe will confirm whether interest earned on the funds can be used for immigration activities. Immigrant advocates allege DeSantis program is 'discriminatory' The Southern Poverty Law Center and other immigration organizations sued DeSantis over the flights in Miami federal court several weeks ago. They allege that DeSantis’ program is discriminatory. They additionally claimed the program is an example of an 'executive of one state infringing upon the federal government’s immigration system by creating a separate, parallel immigration system.' Media, public groups seek more public records over migrant relocation program After the flights were announced in September, the governor’s office has sporadically released public records to the press related to the relocation program, following numerous media requests and even a lawsuit to try to pry the information from DeSantis’ tight-lipped administration. The latest record release came last week. It revealed that Gov. Ron DeSantis’ 'public safety czar '' used a non-government email – heatl9.heatl9@gmail.com – with an account name under 'Clarice Starling'' to help the owner of Vertol Systems Company Inc. get a contract with the state for the migrant relocation program. Starling is the main character in the famous book and movie 'The Silence of the Lambs.' James Montgomerie, the owner, got the contract, and has since received nearly $1.6 million in taxpayer funds. The Miami Herald previously reported that Keefe, who DeSantis appointed as the state’s 'public safety czar' to oversee the governor’s anti-immigration programs, once worked for Vertol Systems as legal counsel. The newspaper reported that he represented the firm in a dozen lawsuits between 2010 and 2017. Other records released showed just how intimately involved the DeSantis administration was in coordinating the flights and revealed inconsistencies between the program deployment and the program guidelines. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Neutral, Magnitude of Bias: 2, Summary: The text provides an overview of the controversies surrounding Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' migrant relocation program.

{"prompt":"Higher education isn’t what it used to be; in fact, it’s become the stark opposite of what it was intended to be. What was once an arena of competing and dueling beliefs with fertile soil for the cultivation of bold and fresh ideas has become a barren desert, occupied almost exclusively by the woke-left agenda. It’s become an institution more fixated on teaching students what to think than how to think. It’s focused on turning students into perpetual victims, anti-American sympathizers and — if it really hits the jackpot — full-fledged social-justice warriors by graduation. And that delusion is why I’m leaving — even as a University of Alabama junior, with just three semesters to go. I no longer have any interest in paying to be told my blackness is a disability and all white people are evil. And asked what my pronouns are when — at least in my opinion — it should be clear as day. When I made the decision to go to college, it was a no-brainer. It was what I was supposed to do, or at least that’s what I was led to believe.It felt not only as if it were the right choice; it felt like the only choice. And this wasn’t a feeling unique to me but one shared by many among the millions of students who enter college every single year — and their parents, who more often than not are the ones footing the bill to send them there. But what if I were to tell you the feeling is rooted in a lie? That, according to a Georgetown University study, there are 30 million jobs paying more than $55,000 a year that don’t require a college degree? That there are six-figure opportunities in careers such as welding, carpentry and even tech that not only don’t require a degree but also don’t come with a prerequisite of hating America? Or what if I were to tell you that this lie — implanted deep into the psyche of our society — is not by accident but by design, as it allows leftist professors to act with near-absolute impunity? It allows institutions like Stanford University to shamelessly embrace the absurd: labeling words such as 'American' and 'grandfather' racist and harmful. It allows Rutgers University to declare a war on grammar — casting it aside as racist in an effort to 'stand with and respond to' the Black Lives Matter movement. And it’s why places like Berkeley — once heralded as a bastion of free speech — have become symbolic of everything wrong with higher education today. Colleges and universities act with impunity because they’re guided by the belief that we need them more than they need us. Conservatives must make it clear that’s simply not the case. Colleges are a business. And it is high time conservatives start making their voices heard using their dollars. If your college goes woke, help them go broke: Withhold your tuition dollars, suspend your alumni contributions or skip a football game or two. (And if you’re a fan of Stanford University football but not a fan of their new harmful-language guide, it should be especially easy: They went 3-9 this past season!)All jokes aside, a false dichotomy has existed among conservatives for far too long: that they must accept the status quo of America’s college campuses or forgo their dreams of living a successful and fruitful life altogether. But this dichotomy is exactly that — false — and conservatives have not just the means to fight back against the woke agenda that pervades our campuses but a moral obligation as well. I say this all to note that I am not opposed to college. I enjoyed the vast majority of my time at the University of Alabama, but even in the Yellowhammer State, my campus experience didn’t come without its challenges. In my freshman year, my dorm-room door was plastered with an expletive-laden anti-Trump posting. During my sophomore year, while campaigning for student government, I was targeted by my school newspaper — slandered as a racist, labeled a homophobe and called a threat to our campus’ marginalized communities. The author of that piece is a white male. I have thick skin, however. And my decision to leave has less to do with my own campus than it does with having a deeply held passion for helping other conservative students in far less-ideal situations hold their own on theirs. We cannot afford to lose our college campuses to the radical left. That would mean we have lost a generation. And to have lost a generation would mean we have lost our country. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 9, Summary: The text expresses a critical perspective on higher education, particularly focusing on the perceived dominance of a ‘woke-left agenda’ and the alleged suppression of conservative voices and ideas on college campuses.

{"prompt":"U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that banning large capacity magazines and requiring a permit to purchase a gun falls in line with 'the nation’s history and tradition of regulating uniquely dangerous features of weapons and firearms to protect public safety,' Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. The decision comes after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment that has upended gun laws across the country, dividing judges and sowing confusion over what firearm restrictions can remain on the books. It changed the test that lower courts had long used for evaluating challenges to firearm restrictions, telling judges that gun laws must be consistent with the 'historical tradition of firearm regulation.' Oregon voters in November narrowly passed Measure 114, which requires residents to undergo safety training and a background check to obtain a permit to buy a gun. The legislation also bans the sale, transfer or import of gun magazines with more than 10 rounds unless they are owned by law enforcement or a military member or were owned before the measure’s passage. Those who already own high-capacity magazines can only possess them at home or use them at a firing range, in shooting competitions or for hunting as allowed by state law after the measure takes effect. Large capacity magazines 'are not commonly used for self-defense, and are therefore not protected by the Second Amendment,' Immergut wrote. 'The Second Amendment also allows governments to ensure that only law-abiding, responsible citizens keep and bear arms.' The latest ruling in U.S. District Court is likely to be appealed, potentially moving all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.

{"prompt":"BELEM, Brazil, Jan 28 (Reuters) - With a disparate cast ranging from Roman Catholic nuns to anarchists, there is one thing the 100,000 leftist activists at the World Social Forum in Brazil can agree on -- it’s hard to hate Barack Obama. Former President George W. Bush was a favorite target of vitriolic anti-U.S. protests at previous editions of one of the world’s biggest gathering of grassroots groups, whose inaugural meeting coincided with the start of Bush’s first term in January 2001. A week after Democrat Obama’s inauguration as U.S. president, the sentiment against Washington at this year’s forum in the sweltering Amazon city of Belem was markedly more subdued. 'People just come up and say ‘Oh my God, thank you so much’ or give you the thumbs up, stuff like that,' said Chad Gray, a 28-year-old graduate student from the United States. Bush’s war in Iraq and policies at home made him an intensely unifying figure for the world’s left-wingers. Effigies of Bush were often burned at leftist rallies but that particular form of protest is now much more unlikely with Obama, the United States’ first black president. Many are grappling with the loss of Bush, who was so unpopular in much of the world that he helped radical groups recruit members and get protesters onto the streets. 'Certainly this will present a difficulty for the movement,' said Altenir Santos of Brazil’s Revolutionary Communist Party, who was handing out leaflets and selling hammer-and-sickle T-shirts on the first full day of the forum on Wednesday. 'The expectations are high because he’s a new person, but we believe that the policies will be the same.' PROBLEM FOR LEFT? The left, especially its more extreme wing, could find it hard to justify its anti-U.S. stance if Obama manages to push through a progressive agenda, said Zander Navarro, a sociologist at the Institute of Development Studies at Britain’s Sussex University. 'If he finds a way of establishing quasi-relations with Cuba, for example, or suspending the economic blockade, the left will find itself paralyzed,' said Navarro, a Brazilian who used to be involved in the country’s leftist land-reform movement. The meeting here brings together groups ranging from communists railing against U.S. 'imperialism' to environmentalists and more moderate socialists, as well as some government leaders. Predictably, there was division over whether Obama’s presidency was a positive development, even though he has already ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison for terrorist suspects -- a long-held demand of the left. 'Bush wasn’t all bad and Obama all good. People will have to see that it is more complicated than that,' said Ze Oumon, a researcher with Belgium’s National Center for Cooperation and Development. 'He is the president of the United States so that means perhaps having some special interests.' But Bertrand Monthubert of France’s Socialist Party said that even if Obama’s presidency didn’t turn out as revolutionary as some hoped, it was still a vast improvement from Bush and a boost for the left. 'To be united we have to have some examples of governments from the left that succeed,' he said. 'The most terrible thing for workers and people who struggle for food and development is that they have no hope. So at least having a hope like this is a way to reinforce the struggle they make.'

{"prompt":"Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville has held up the confirmation of more than 260 generals for new command posts — including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Marine Corps — over his objections to the Pentagon’s abortion policy. Tuberville, a former football coach who is closely allied with former President Donald Trump, has refused to go forward with the routine confirmations and is essentially using defense policy as leverage to promote his cultural ideology. But the Department of Defense has repeatedly warned that holding up the confirmations is damaging the military’s chain of command at the highest levels, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff — especially concerning amid a time of increasing tension between the US and China, and as the US supports Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. 'These are our nominees who have incredibly important jobs all around the world, who are working with our partners and allies,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said in an interview with Fox News Thursday. 'And it sends a message to our adversaries.' Any senator can hold up these confirmations, even if the other 99 wish to move forward with them, because of the Senate concept of unanimous consent, which is not a formal Senate rule but allows the body to make changes to regular order to expedite legislating such as allowing batch confirmations. Unanimous consent can apply to all different parts of the Senate’s legislative process — everything from limiting debates and amendments to scheduling votes — and essentially means that the body has decided to dispense with the Senate’s usual procedures in the interests of moving business forward. It’s not always part of the legislative process, but it’s used so often that there are rules and precedents surrounding it. The Senate has long relied on unanimous consent to promote military personnel through batch confirmations, but with Tuberville’s hold, the only way to move the confirmations forward would be to vote on them one by one, through regular order. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Associated Press that doing so would take up to 84 days with the chamber working regular, eight-hour days, or 27 days if they worked 'around the clock.' Tuberville’s hold, which could affect 650 military promotions by the year’s end, is based on a misrepresentation of how the Pentagon’s abortion policy works. And he isn’t the only Republican using legislation related to the military to force right-wing policies into defense policy. House Freedom Caucus members scored a victory this week when the House passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that included amendments limiting abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and diversity, equality, and inclusion programs. 'This bill has been transformed into an extremist manifesto,' House Minority Whip Katherine Clark told CNN after the bill passed. In a macro sense, right-wing Republicans’ push to undo progress in the DoD both echoes and foreshadows their intent to halt the business of governing to try to codify policies that many Americans don’t support. And on a more specific scale, it affects the overall functioning of the military — everything from funding, to the chain of command, down to military families trying to plan moves to new bases. Tuberville and House Freedom Caucus members are also breaking with decades of Republican tradition by failing to support the military and military policy. Tuberville’s hold misunderstands the Pentagon’s abortion policy Tuberville has weaponized the tradition of unanimous consent to try to limit service members’ access to abortion, because he claims it violates the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal money being used for abortion. However, Tuberville’s claims don’t actually comport with Pentagon policy, which allows service members or their families to take time off and use official travel mechanisms and funding, as they would for any other type of travel, to seek abortion care in another location. However, the Pentagon doesn’t pay for service members to get abortions, nor do the new policies provide for government health insurance to cover abortions — both of which the Hyde Amendment actually prohibits. Since 1993, the Hyde Amendment has made exceptions to allow federal funds to pay for abortion care in the case of rape or incest, or risk to the health or life of a pregnant person. That also holds true in the military, though available data indicates these cases are quite rare. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin laid out the updated abortion policy regarding time off and official travel in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 3, Summary: The article criticizes Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville for holding up the confirmation of more than 260 generals for new command posts in objection to the Pentagon's abortion policy.

Correct the Record's 'Barrier Breakers' project boasts in a press release that is has already 'addressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.' It's bad when you have to defend 'your guy' from that many people. It makes sense, considering she has an unfavorable rating of historic proportions. Also, what exactly does this 'push back' entail? A peek at the CTR Barrier Breakers press release offers no additional detail as to what their so called 'strategy' against 'swarms of anonymous attackers' is. And why would they need $1 MILLION to do whatever it is they're doing?People online have complained about being banned from Hillary Clinton groups and having their comments deleted without reason. One Reddit user helped to specify CTR's intentionally vague scope of practice: They're spending [millions of dollars] on two areas: opposition research, and rapid-response. The research part is pretty self-explanatory, but the rapid response bit is really interesting. They're essentially hiring staffers who astroturf reddit, Facebook, write blogs on free mediums like Tumblr, flood comment sections on news articles, call into radio shows and otherwise just act as a 'first responder' on the scene whenever a news story breaks out. They get their talking points from the Clinton campaign, and then they flood the discussion and attempt to steer it.The Daily Beast also confirms that the CTR PAC works directly in coordination with the Clinton campaign. Due to FEC loopholes, the Sunlight Foundation's Libby Watson found this year that Correct the Record can openly coordinate with Clinton's campaign, despite rules that typically disallow political campaigns from working directly with PACs. We already knew that Hillary has a proclivity for doing things illegally... But upon discovering her lack of popularity with the general public, why is the response to try to correct the way the public thinks? Why not change herself? She's the common denominator in all of this. People all over the country don't like her. It has nothing to do with misinformation or trolling, and everything to do with her being a terrible candidate for the presidency.But, like most leftists, she resorts to censorship and control. It's old hat. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 9, Summary: The article expresses a strong dislike for Hillary Clinton and portrays her as unpopular and untrustworthy.

{"prompt":"CNN CEO Chris Licht cut right to the chase on Thursday’s 9 a.m. call with network staff. 'I realize there’s been backlash and that’s expected,' he said about the widely criticized town hall CNN hosted with former president Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, the night before. Licht congratulated moderator Kaitlan Collins 'on a masterful performance,' in which she 'asked the tough questions and followed up and fact-checked Donald Trump in real time' and 'made a ton of news.' He referenced an Axios piece—an article that downplayed the outrage as 'Twitter-bubble hysterics'—that did an 'incredible job laying out everything new we learned.' Watching Wednesday’s town hall, though, news was hardly the takeaway. It was an ugly spectacle, in which the former president lied about everything from the 2020 election to the January 6 Capitol attack that he incited and Democrats’ abortion policies. He smeared the writer E. Jean Carroll, a day after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming her. And the live audience, of New Hampshire Republican and undeclared primary voters, laughed and cheered as he did. When the town hall concluded after about 70 minutes, CNN turned to a panel that included GOP representative Byron Donalds, who refused to concede that Trump lost the 2020 election and attacked Collins’s moderation. 'I suspect you won’t see him on [air] talking about election results in the future,' a source close to Licht told Vanity Fair. Prior to the town hall, producers were concerned about the recap panels being too negative on Trump, Vanity Fair has learned. There was also concern that Trump might walk off in the early portion of the town hall, and producers wanted the recap panelists seated and ready to go by 8 p.m. in case the main event ended earlier than planned. When the town hall concluded, many of the faces on the panel, save for Donalds, appeared stricken, a sober mood in sharp contrast to the preshow punditry talk that gave some déjà vu to 2016. 'This will not come as a shock,' said one CNN journalist, 'but I don’t know anyone who was happy with last night. The mood is absolutely the lowest it’s been in the Licht tenure, and that’s saying a lot.' None of what Trump did Wednesday night is new. He has been lying about his election loss to Joe Biden for nearly two and a half years, and started rewriting other parts of history long before that. What was different, however, was seeing it play out on CNN. This was Trump’s first appearance on CNN in years—he hasn’t done an interview with the network since his 2016 presidential campaign, and repeatedly dismissed CNN as 'fake news' throughout his presidency. The town hall was CNN’s idea, one the network brought to veteran Trump adviser Jason Miller a couple months ago, per The Wall Street Journal. Licht had 'taken an especially hands-on role preparing for the event,' Politico reported. 'It’s a reset for Chris,' an insider told the outlet. But the town hall seemed out of CNN’s control from the get-go, made worse by the crowd, which applauded Trump when he called Collins 'a nasty person' and suggested 'she doesn’t understand' the subject matter, and laughed when he called Carroll 'a whack job.' (Politico reported earlier on Wednesday that the Trump campaign is 'expected to fundraise off the Carroll decision.') On Thursday morning’s call, Licht noted that 'while it might’ve been uncomfortable to hear people clapping in response to some of the president’s answers, that audience represents the views of a large swath of America. The mistake the media made in the past is ignoring that they exist.' He added, 'Just as you cannot ignore that President Trump exists. The idea of doing so is [an] overcorrection of a time when nets took campaign rallies live.' Wednesday’s town hall, though, seemed to confirm that while the media cannot ignore Trump, it also cannot treat him like any other candidate. That was CNN’s approach going in: The network’s political director David Chalian told me last week that Trump being a 'unique candidate…does not make our approach any different, in the sense that we hold every candidate who comes to CNN accountable for their words.' The issue Wednesday, however, was that Trump simply spewed out too many falsehoods for any moderator to catch them all. Many gave Collins credit: 'This isn’t @kaitlancollins fault (she is doing the best one can), but this is a gushing geyser of disinformation that cannot be fact-checked in real time,' former Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer tweeted. Collins covered the Trump White House for CNN, and on several occasions clashed publicly with the former president. Such incidents ranged from Trump declaring CNN 'fake news' to banning Collins from a Rose Garden press conference after she asked questions about former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and Russian president Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, Trump repeated some of familiar lines and lies, including calling the deadly Capitol attack 'a beautiful day' and saying former vice president Mike Pence had the power to 'put the votes back to the state legislatures' and overturn the results (he did not have that authority). He continued to stand by his remarks about women in the 2005 Access Hollywood tape, in which he bragged about grabbing women 'by the pussy'—comments he doubled down on in his taped deposition for the Carroll suit. 'I can’t take it back because it happens to be true,' Trump told Collins Wednesday. He also lied about abortion, claiming baselessly—in a statement that went unchecked—that before Roe v. Wade was overturned, 'they could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born.' ->","completion":" Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 4, Summary: The article criticizes CNN's hosting of a town hall event with former President Donald Trump, highlighting the lies and controversial statements made by Trump during the event. It questions CNN's decision to give Trump a platform and suggests that the network lost control of the event, particularly due to the audience's response to Trump's remarks. The article also mentions past clashes between Trump and CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins.

{"prompt":"We could be mere weeks away from former President Donald Trump getting hit with yet another set of criminal charges. This time the threat is coming from Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has spent the past 17 months probing Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the state. And according to previous reports, she’s aiming to decide whether to bring indictments sometime between roughly now and Sept. 1. In an attempt to head off Willis, Trump’s lawyers on Thursday filed a petition with the Georgia Supreme Court to have the district attorney disqualified from investigating him. The filing explicitly acknowledges what a long shot their bid is — and implicitly makes clear just how worried Trump is about facing another set of charges that he potentially won’t be able to wriggle out of if re-elected. Earlier this week, a Fulton County superior court judge seated two grand juries, one of which will hear likely evidence in the case against Trump. That likely evidence includes the final report from a special grand jury that Willis convened last year to investigate whether Trump broke state law in trying to have state officials toss out Joe Biden’s win in 2020. The full report has yet to be made public, but in February the jury foreperson said in an NBC News interview that the panel had recommended indictments against more than a dozen people — possibly including Trump. In petitioning the Georgia Supreme Court, Trump’s lawyers are seeking to both quash that report and get a ruling that would prevent Willis from using any of the evidence the special grand jury obtained in support of possible charges. But this isn’t the first time that Trump has tried to disqualify her from the case — his legal team filed a similar petition to quash the special grand jury report with the Fulton County Superior Court in March. And much like in the current Supreme Court filing, that previous attempt included 'a kitchen sink of legal arguments' thrown at Willis’ probe, as my colleague Jordan Rubin described it.But Judge Robert McBurney has yet to issue a ruling on that filing. Trump’s lawyers say that leaves him 'stranded between the Supervising Judge’s protracted passivity and the District Attorney’s looming indictment.' Their argument in a nutshell: Willis and McBurney, who is also a respondent to the petition along with Willis, are being unfair to Trump. They then conclude that the only course of action is to have the Georgia Supreme Court leapfrog not just the appeals courts but pre-empt the initial ruling. When compared with his normal attempts to grind the judicial process to a halt, Trump urging a court to move quickly takes on a certain air of desperation. In the filing his lawyers acknowledge that there has been no case in which the Georgia Supreme Court has accepted a petition of original jurisdiction in the past 40 years. It also reflects the fact that in a way the threat of charges from Willis is the biggest threat to him in the long-term.he federal charges that he faces in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case are serious, to be sure. So is the potential chance that special counsel Jack Smith indicts Trump on his role in the lead-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. But a conviction in either case still wouldn’t necessarily prevent Trump from serving as president if re-elected — and as soon as he’s sworn-in he could theoretically pardon himself even before a verdict comes in either case. There’s no chance of that in the hush money case that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought against Trump in March. State-level convictions can’t be overturned using the presidential pardon power, leaving him vulnerable on that front. But the legal argument that Bragg has used to prosecute his case is a relatively novel one that doesn’t guarantee a conviction against the former president.Willis’ investigation presents a potential worst-case scenario for Trump. There’s plentiful evidence at this point that showcases his attempts to reverse Biden’s win, including his infamous call to have officials 'find' 11,780 votes for him. There’s also the little matter of his team recruiting a slate of 'fake electors' to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for him to Congress. Any case against Trump in Georgia has the potential to combine the severity of Smith’s case with the jurisdictional threat that Bragg’s represents into one massive legal problem. The odds seem low that Trump will succeed in this Hail Mary play. But that he’s having his lawyers give it a shot anyway speaks to how determined he is to prevent this case from moving forward. And in the meantime, the clock is ticking away before Willis potentially makes Trump’s summer much, much worse. ->","completion":" <Political Direction: Left.

{"prompt":"A couple of years ago, an '80 percent' receiver I purchased refused to accept parts, let alone chamber and fire cartridges, until my son and I drilled and milled it to completion; that's because unfinished firearms are not firearms. For a long time, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) agreed. But, pressured by the Biden administration, the ATF tried to extend firearms regulations to a lot of things that aren't guns but could, with work, become one. Now a federal judge is injecting some sense, ruling in a lawsuit that bureaucrats can't just decide that inert objects are guns.Feds Change the Rules on Gun Hobbyists For years, through a page still on its website, federal gun regulators assured the public that 'ATF has long held that items such as receiver blanks, 'castings' or 'machined bodies' in which the fire-control cavity area is completely solid and un-machined have not reached the 'stage of manufacture' which would result in the classification of a firearm.' That's good sense unless you look forward to background checks and government scrutiny every time you visit the hardware store where all sorts of items that could be turned into guns are sold. It also gave guidance to companies that serve firearms hobbyists by selling unfinished receivers (the regulated part of firearms) and other components to people who build their own firearms using traditional workshop tools or high-tech computer numerical control (CNC) machines and 3D printers. But everything that can be used can be misused. Anti-gun activists built those misuses into a moral panic over 'ghost guns' based on a lot of florid language. Their efforts are self-defeating since DIY gunmaking gained popularity specifically as a means of rendering gun control unenforceable. But that didn't stop authoritarian policymakers, and the Biden administration went all-in on efforts to inconvenience DIY hobbyists in the name of stopping 'ghost guns.' The result was a hot mess of a rule change that would expand firearms regulation on the ATF's say-so without any legislation. That left legal analysts agreeing on little except that the agency gave its own people wide discretion and that lawsuits were inevitable. The ATF Can't Just Make Things Up, Now or In the Past One of those lawsuits, VanDerStok v. Garland, brought by Jennifer VanDerStok, Blackhawk Manufacturing Group, and other plaintiffs, has now resulted in a loss for the federal government. On July 5, building on a preliminary injunction issued last year, Judge Reed O'Connor of the U.S. District Court for Northern Texas wrote that the 'Final Rule was issued in excess of ATF's statutory jurisdiction' and the 'Definition of 'Frame or Receiver' and Identification of Firearms…is hereby VACATED.' Reed gave his reasoning days earlier, on June 30, in his memorandum opinion. 'A part that has yet to be completed or converted to function as frame or receiver is not a frame or receiver,' O'Connor wrote. 'ATF's declaration that a component is a 'frame or receiver' does not make it so if, at the time of evaluation, the component does not yet accord with the ordinary public meaning of those terms.' Elsewhere in the opinion, Judge O'Connor rejected the ATF's astonishment that any court could take issue with the agency's arbitrary reclassification of inert items as firearms. 'Defendants offer several classification letters in which ATF previously determined that a particular component was (or was not) a 'firearm' for purposes of the [Gun Control Act of 1968] based on the item's stage of manufacture,' O'Connor chided the feds. 'But historical practice does not dictate the interpretation of unambiguous statutory terms. The ordinary public meaning of those terms does. If these administrative records show, as Defendants contend, that ATF has previously regulated components that are not yet frames or receivers but could readily be converted into such items, then the historical practice does nothing more than confirm that the agency has, perhaps in multiple specific instances over several decades, exceeded the lawful bounds of its statutory jurisdiction.' In other words: Thank you for this evidence that you have repeatedly exceeded your authority! 'We're thrilled to see the Court agree that ATF's Frame or Receiver Rule exceeds the agency's congressionally limited authority,' commented Cody J. Wisniewski, who represented the plaintiffs in this case as counsel for the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC). 'With this decision, the Court has properly struck down ATF's Rule and ensured that it cannot enforce that which it never had the authority to publish in the first place.' 'With this effort to rewrite federal regulations, Biden tried to make countless individuals criminals,' agreed plaintiff's co-counsel Mountain States Legal Foundation. 'But Mountain States and FPC sued, and argued that the rule was illegal, on behalf of Jennifer VanDerStok, Mike Andren, and Tactical Machining. Our winning argument was that the ATF exceeded its authority, as outlined by Congress.' It's Not Over Yet (But the Control Freaks Are Doomed) As strong a decision as this is, it's at the district level and can be expected to run the gauntlet up the judicial food chain before being ultimately decided one way or the other. The U.S. Department of Justice has already filed a notice of appeal in the case as well as an emergency motion for stay to try to keep the rule in effect while litigation continues. Clearly, the feds fear losing control of the situation. But, as mentioned above, governments lost control long ago. DIY gunmaking became popular as a deliberate effort to evade draconian laws. Then 3D printing and CNC machines helped make DIY gunmaking that much simpler. After the ATF released its restrictive new rules regarding unfinished receivers, the industry, led by Ghost Gunner, moved to 'zero-percent' blocks of material to be finished by hobbyists (In June, Reason TV interviewed Cody Wilson, who brought us Ghost Gunner as well as 3D-printed firearms). There are also the rapidly growing ranks of gun owners to consider. Driven by the social tensions of recent years, gun sales rose to record levels and came to encompass Americans who didn't adhere to traditional stereotypes of white, rural conservatives. 'Liberal, female and minority: America's new gun owners aren't who you'd think,' CNN headlined a story last September. Researchers say that these new gun owners are even more protective of their privacy than those who came before them. That leaves anti-gun politicians to wonder if they can still assume their constituents are as unlikely to be directly harmed by gun restrictions as in the past; elected officials love using legislation to lash out at perceived enemies, but pushing punitive laws that hurt your own base is no way to win reelection. For now, Judge O'Connor's decision in VanDerStok v. Garland is a small but significant win in an ongoing dispute between pro-liberty activists and control freaks who want to disarm the public. But no matter how the legal battles shake out, advocates of control effectively lost the war long ago. Many people are working to ensure that, no matter what government officials want, guns will remain in private hands. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 4, Summary: The article discusses a recent ruling by a federal judge in the case of VanDerStok v.

{"prompt":"On July 13, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finally allowed women to access one birth control pill over the counter. The FDA signaled in May that this was likely to happen after an advisory panel recommended that the agency approve over-the-counter marketing of the progestin-only oral contraceptive Opill, manufactured by the Dublin-based Perrigo Company. Progestin-only oral contraceptives have been around since 1973. Dubbed the 'mini pill,' these contraceptives have their limitations. For example, women must take the pill at the same time every day, within a three-hour window. If they miss the window, they must discontinue the pill and begin again with the next cycle. With standard birth control pills that combine estrogen and progesterone, women who miss a daily dose can double up the next day. Women who take progestin-only pills have a slightly lower risk of developing blood clots that can break off and travel through the body (venous thromboembolism, or VTE) than they do with combination pills. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which has for decades advocated making all hormonal contraceptives available over the counter for women of all ages, states the risk of VTE 'with combined oral contraceptive use is small compared with the increased risk of VTE during pregnancy and the postpartum period.' ACOG is not the only medical professional organization calling to free the birth control pill. It is joined by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Medical Association. And most reproductive health care providers surveyed in 2016 favored over-the-counter birth control pills. These medical experts, who get paid to evaluate women and prescribe hormonal contraceptives, have the financial incentive to argue for maintaining the status quo. When they repeatedly assert that women do not need their services to obtain birth control pills, regulators should take notice. The FDA approved over-the-counter emergency contraception, the so-called morning-after pill, for women of all ages in 2013. These pills (for example, Plan B) usually contain high progestin levels. But standard birth control pills can also be used for emergency contraception. The required dose is 8-10 pills. The FDA denies women over-the-counter access to contraceptives with one-eighth to one-tenth the potency of over-the-counter emergency contraceptives. In a Cato Institute white paper, Director of Health Policy Studies Michael F. Cannon and I pointed out that birth control pills are available in more than 100 countries without a prescription. In a January 2020 Los Angeles Times column, we explained that switching a drug from prescription-only to over-the-​counter status typically causes its price to fall. But don't expect prices for the mini pill to fall soon. Because the FDA will only allow women to purchase this one brand of mini pill without a prescription, it will be shielded from price competition by rival brands. Minors can buy lethal amounts of acetaminophen and ibuprofen without a prescription. Yet adult women must get a permission slip from another adult to exercise the right to contraceptive self-medication. And we other adults—licensed health care clinicians—think the requirement is preposterous. The FDA took a mini step in the right direction by allowing women over-the-counter access to one mini pill. But Americans should not be satisfied until all forms of hormonal contraception are set free from the government's yoke. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 5, Summary: The article discusses the recent FDA approval of over-the-counter access to the progestin-only oral contraceptive pill, highlighting that this is a step in the right direction but arguing for complete over-the-counter availability of all forms of hormonal contraception.

{"prompt":"Several California Assembly members this year introduced a constitutional amendment that declares housing a 'fundamental right.' Who knew? Lawmakers have wrestled with innumerable complex issues over the years, but finally someone realized that all they needed to do to magically solve any problem is to pass a new 'right' to something. Expected soon: constitutional amendments declaring 'rights' to a million dollars, to a brand-new electric SUV, and to a dog that's properly housebroken. Sorry for the facetiousness, but Assembly Constitutional Amendment 10 epitomizes the lack of seriousness we've come to expect from the Legislature. Actually fixing the housing problem is a tough slog. The legislation, which would need approval by California voters, is modeled on United Nations measures from 1948 and 1966 declaring similar rights. The world's housing stock has dramatically improved since then, but anyone who thinks that two toothless UN measures were the cause—rather than a booming market economy—really should claim the right to a therapist. This proposed amendment is remarkably demanding. The Assembly analysis explains that the measure isn't a right to 'shelter,' which it finds inadequate. 'The right to adequate housing should not be interpreted narrowly,' it notes. 'Rather, it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace, and dignity.' Yet a state that can't provide basic shelter for 180,000 homeless people shouldn't be promising inchoate benefits such as dignity. The legislation also defines the right to housing as 'a right to protection from forced evictions, equal and nondiscriminatory access to housing, and that housing must be adequate.' That means housing 'with security of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities, and infrastructure' along with a location that offers 'cultural adequacy.' Huh? I have no idea what it means to have housing with 'cultural adequacy,' but I do know what it means to have 'protection from forced evictions' and 'security of tenure.' That seems to mean that landlords would no longer be able to evict tenants for almost any reason, perhaps even including nonpayment of rent. That creates a practical (not to mention a constitutional) problem. If a property owner can't properly vet tenants and potentially can't evict them, then they aren't going to invest in or rent out apartments. They certainly aren't going to make repairs to houses lived in by non-paying tenants, which will make the housing stock less adequate. We need more housing, not less, and such edicts discourage housing investment. For precedent, ACA 10's supporters point to the state's 'Human Right to Water' law declaring 'that every human being has a right to safe, clean, affordable and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.' Signed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2012, it sounded noble. Who doesn't want everyone to have potable water? But in the ensuing years, the state failed to provide clean drinking water to poor, farm-worker towns in the south San Joaquin Valley, even though the fix (hooking up those communities to infrastructure in neighboring water districts) was a tiny expense relative to the state budget. Apparently, the state is willing to grant human rights as it sees fit—but only if they're cheap and easy. Following that law's passage, the state continued to neglect its duty to build more water infrastructure. So spare us these meaningless 'rights' bills, which seem designed to result in press conferences rather than meaningful solutions. In fairness, some of ACA 10's goals are reasonable—e.g., pushing localities to approve more housing construction. But this law wouldn't accomplish that. The state already is taking a serious approach toward deregulating land use through laws such as Senate Bills 9 and 10, which create a 'by right' approval process for duplexes and mid-rise condos. The state also is battling NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) cities such as Huntington Beach, which are fighting the laws' implementation in the court system. Those laws—and ones that reduce parking minimums and allow developers to build housing on commercial sites—were the result of hard work that involved tough negotiations, coalition building, and the usual legislative sausage-making. This 'housing right' amendment is an affront to those efforts by pretending that there's a shortcut. There's also much wrong philosophically with creating new 'rights' via legislation and voter initiative. Historically, there are two types of rights—'negative' ones and 'positive' ones. The former protects individuals from government usurpations. The First Amendment's speech protections ('Congress shall make no law …') is the premiere negative-right example. By contrast, your positive right to housing means the government must force others to give it to you by taking their money (via taxation) or undermining their property rights (by limiting their right to evict you). Not only is that approach ethically wrong, but it will only lead to fewer available rentals. Then again, there's nothing we can do to rein in lawmakers' right to introduce worthless legislation. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 4, Summary: The article criticizes the introduction of a constitutional amendment in California declaring housing a 'fundamental right,' dismissing it as lacking seriousness and a misguided attempt to solve the housing problem.

The article also criticizes other 'rights' bills and emphasizes the importance of negative rights over positive rights. The overall tone is critical of the proposed amendment and suggests it is not a meaningful solution to the housing problem.\n"}
{"prompt":"Based on his private statements to colleagues, we know that former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson did not believe Trump lawyer Sidney Powell's wild claims about systematic fraud in the 2020 presidential election. 'Sidney Powell is lying,' Carlson flatly stated in a November 16, 2020, text message to fellow Fox News host Laura Ingraham that came to light as a result of the defamation lawsuit that Dominion Voting Systems filed against the channel. Ingraham agreed that Powell could not be trusted: 'Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy [Giuliani].' We also know, again thanks to discovery in the Dominion lawsuit, that Carlson had a low opinion of Donald Trump. In a November 10 text message, he called Trump's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration 'hard to believe,' 'so destructive,' and 'disgusting.' He was more broadly critical in a January 4, 2021, text message to his staff. 'There isn't really an upside to Trump,' he said describing 'the last four years' as 'a disaster.' Carlson was eager for a change: 'We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait. I hate him passionately.' The day after the January 6 Capitol riot by Trump supporters, Carlson privately called him 'a demonic force' and 'a destroyer.' Carlson, who launched a new show on Twitter after Fox News fired him in April, was singing a different tune yesterday at the Turning Point Action Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida. 'Why were they so mad?' he said during a giddy, meandering 44-minute speech at the pro-Trump gathering, referring to the Capitol rioters. 'Why do they take the bus from Tennessee to go jump up and down in front of the Capitol?' The answer, he said, is that they were frustrated by the patronizing, dismissive response to their legitimate concerns about how the presidential election had been conducted. Carlson suggested it was laughably implausible that Joe Biden had received '81 million votes'—'15 million more than Barack Obama,' which 'seems like a lot'—especially 'considering [that] he didn't campaign and he can't talk.' But instead of taking that reaction seriously, Carlson said, the political and journalistic establishment told Trump's supporters to 'settle down,' saying, 'We have the source code in the voting machine software, and we've looked at it, and it's totally on the level. We've double-checked. We wouldn't let an electronic voting [company] hide their software from us.' The unfounded claim that deliberately corrupted Dominion software enabled Biden to steal the election, of course, was the central issue in the company's lawsuit against Fox, which the parties settled for a jaw-dropping $788 million shortly before Carlson got the boot. It was also the claim that Carlson privately dismissed as dangerous nonsense. 'It's unbelievably offensive to me,' he told Ingraham. 'Our viewers are good people and they believe it.' The next day, Carlson made his doubts public, albeit in less categorical terms. If what Powell said were true, he said on his show, it would be 'the single greatest crime in American history.' But he noted that Powell, despite repeated requests from his staff, had declined to back up her claims with evidence. Yet now Carlson, who was transparently craving the adulation of the Trump supporters in West Palm Beach, is reinforcing their conviction that Biden could have won the election only through a vast criminal conspiracy that Carlson publicly called unsubstantiated and privately called a lie. He apparently has swallowed any disgust he once felt at Powell et al.'s deception of 'good people.' What about the politician who persistently promoted that conspiracy theory and embraces it to this day? 'Republicans elected a guy basically on the promise to blow up the Republican Party,' Carlson said, which should have been cause for reflection within the GOP establishment. But mainstream Republican politicians did not take the lessons of Trump's victory to heart, he complained, and today they are abetting Biden's 'perversion of leadership' vis-à-vis the war in Ukraine, a failure that Carlson said is 'disgusting' because it fosters 'chaos.' In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot, Carlson privately viewed Trump as an agent of chaos, and not in a good way. The sooner the GOP was rid of Trump's influence, Carlson thought, the better. 'Trump has two weeks left,' he told his staff the day after the riot. 'Once he's out, he becomes incalculably less powerful, even in the minds of his supporters.' That is not quite the way things worked out. Trump currently is by far the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, about 30 points ahead of his closest competitor. And so Carlson, like the Republican politicians whose phoniness he detests, has adjusted to the reality that Trump continues to dominate the GOP. 'Whatever you think of Trump,' Carlson said, 'he's pretty clear on this [i.e., the need for decisive leadership in foreign affairs], and they hate him for it actually. They hate him for it.' Carlson's attempt to have it both ways regarding Trump's stolen-election fantasy was apparent from the January 26, 2021, show in which he gave MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell a forum to regurgitate that story. More than two months after Carlson had publicly rebuked Powell for making unsubstantiated claims about machine-facilitated election fraud, he interviewed Lindell, ostensibly on the subject of 'cancel culture.' Lindell predictably seized the opportunity to repeat the charge that Carlson had dismissed—the same charge that would eventually cost Fox $788 million. Lindell said 'we have all the evidence' to show Dominion's complicity in election fraud and complained that 'they just say, 'Oh, you're wrong.'' Instead of asking Lindell to elaborate on that 'evidence,' Carlson sympathized with his complaint. 'They're not making conspiracy theories go away by doing that,' Carlson said. 'You…don't make people kind of calm down and get reasonable and moderate by censoring them. You make them get crazier, of course. This is…ridiculous.' That comment, Fox argued, implied skepticism by referring to 'conspiracy theories.' Dominion argued that 'a regular viewer of Carlson's would likely have thought Carlson changed his mind on the subject, given how differently he treated Lindell than he had treated Powell.' Now Carlson is doubling down on the position he took during that interview. The real scandal, he claims to think, is not that the president of the United States refused to accept an electoral loss and instead promoted one specious claim after another in an effort to overturn, or at least cast doubt on, the outcome. The real scandal, Carlson says, is that those claims were not taken seriously enough. Carlson positions himself as a bold truth teller who is unafraid to tell it like it is. But his slippery handling of Trump's tall tale shows he is no more trustworthy than the politicians he despises. ->","completion":" <Political Direction: Left, Magnitude of Bias: 5, Summary: The article criticizes Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News personality, for his contradictory statements and handling of the 2020 presidential election fraud claims.

The author accuses Carlson of seeking adulation from Trump supporters and argues that he is not a trustworthy truth-teller. The overall tone is critical of Carlson's handling of the election fraud claims and his shift in stance on Trump's influence in the Republican Party.>\n"}
{"prompt":"Last year, a lesbian writer shared she was assigned '20 Transphobic JK Rowling Quotes We’re Done With.' It was our first confirmation that editors assign writers clickbait, and expect them to fill in the holes. Keep that in the back of your mind. Luke Combs (straight\/white\/male) has a hit with his cover of Tracy Chapman's (black\/female\/lesbian...or I guess we say 'queer' now) hit 'Fast Car.' As an oldhead who grew up in the 80s and who, unlike millennials and zoomers, knows that America existed prior to Barack Obama in 2009, I can tell you the Chapman's song was HUGE. It was all over the place. Chapman was one of the top stars in pop music. The song was such a hit, it was parodied on sketch comedy shows.So of course the journalisming content creators at Washington Post felt it necessary to try and create racism and homophobia where none existed.In 1989, Tracy Chapman won the Grammy for Best New Artist and Best Folk Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. 'Fast Car,' in 1989, won Best Female Pop Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Apropos of nothing, the winner of those awards was another black artist. Bobby McFerrin for 'Don't Worry, Be Happy.' On top of all this? Black, queer, and female Tracy Chapman OWNS the publishing rights and songwriting credits so she is getting a lion's share of the royalties on Combs' hit.

{"prompt":"here was great outrage this week at the revelation that Church of England schools are teaching pupils a ‘pyramid of white supremacy’ and anti-racism theory that says ‘avoiding confrontation’ can lead to genocide. To me, however, and to thousands of concerned parents up and down the land, this is hardly news. In art class, my children have been instructed to make Black Lives Matter posters. Assemblies in recent years have been a dreary parade of presentations on sexuality, identity and race politics. They have been subjected to workshops involving LGBTQI+ flash cards and printouts of tweets about transgenderism, and taught that Sam Smith – who is obviously overweight and wears provocative bondage clothing – is a shining example of ‘body positivity.’It’s not that I object to them being exposed to this stuff at school. I’d be quite happy for identity politics to be presented critically and examined alongside competing philosophies. They are teenagers and it’s an unavoidable part of contemporary culture. But there’s a difference between teaching and preaching. In too many British schools, a fashionable creed is presented as an ideological certainty, brooking no opposition. Independent thinking is discouraged and dissent, however reasonable, is suppressed. You thought that story about a pupil being rebuked for refusing to accept that it was reasonable to identify as a cat was an outlier? Think again. This stuff is all over the education system like a drag queen’s make-up. Last week, a report by the campaign group Don’t Divide Us looked at the way schools have allowed organisations to teach controversial ‘anti-racism’ theories. The materials they looked at included ‘unconscious bias’, ‘privilege’ and ‘micro-aggressions’. The teaching profession is being ‘radicalised’, the report’s author, Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, said. This is social engineering – no, social experimentation – on a massive scale, using our children as the monkeys. And there has been zero democratic consent. At a sixth form college near where I live in Winchester, teachers have been given training sessions in which they are forced to play ‘privilege bingo’ and bombarded with the latest in ‘neurodivergent’ ideology. Wall displays promoting the creed of ‘EDI’ (equality, diversity and inclusion) are ubiquitous. This is the intentional seeding of social contagion. In the children’s section of my local library, a display of books includes titles like Who Are You? The Kid’s Guide To Gender Identity; Princess Kevin; and Black Artists Shaping The World. Clearly, the rise of dogmatic moralising is reflected in the demise of quality fiction. Milan Kundera, who died last week, put it best. ‘All over the world people nowadays prefer to judge rather than to understand, to answer rather than to ask, so that the voice of the novel can hardly be heard over the noisy foolishness of human certainties,’ he wrote. Parents are powerless in the face of this rising tide. They are locked out of the school system, with the government only just getting round to issuing non-statutory guidance stipulating that they should be informed if their children are ‘socially transitioning’ (official guidance is expected this week). All well and good, but King Canute himself would have scoffed. This is heart-breaking, and to a parent it feels like a personal and societal failure.  As for the teachers, those who harbour private alarm at the spread of the cult are intimidated into silence, fearing for their careers. The best they can manage is delivering mandated ideological instruction in a half-hearted or subversive way. (Though I do know one or two souls who carry the torch online, using pseudonyms.) Meanwhile the government, until very recently, has done woefully little to counter this disturbing trend, effectively conceding the education system to a cabal of zealots, fanatics and ideological cultists who seek to mould the future of our country by moulding the minds of our children. The tragic conclusion is clear: the only ones capable of saving society are our children themselves. Just as the treatment of the year eight pupil arguing about feline self-identification was not an outlier, the bravery of the child herself was not entirely unusual. There aren’t that many of them, but there are some courageous souls who are determined to go down fighting. Only our children can stand up for their friends. It is as depressing as it is true. A larger and larger number of youngsters are sliding into confused introversion as they try to work out which of the umpteen different sexual identities they should ‘identify with’, rather than just getting on with living their lives and working things out naturally as they go along. Many are taking on different genders and playing with fantasies of disfiguring, painful and life-changing surgery. Mental health difficulties are soaring among young people, and even those who have not succumbed have been left ill-equipped to deal with the cut and thrust of the real world when they grow up. Teachers – who themselves benefited from childhoods free from all this stuff – expend much effort providing emotional support to anxious and mollycoddled teens. This is like poisoning them while cushioning the symptoms; given the amount of time they spend enforcing gender and race ideology, it’s a wonder they get any teaching done at all. The remaining children who, usually as a result of good early years’ parenting, still have brains and hearts intact, are increasingly distressed. And with the government coming too late and too weakly to the fight, they are starting to shoulder the burden. Recently, after a particularly galling lesson about the number of ‘genders’ that apparently exist – was it 46? 200? 1,000? – my son engaged his teacher in debate. You’re not supposed to be promoting political views at school, he pointed out. ‘It’s not political, it’s politicised,’ the teacher nonsensically replied. In response to this word salad, my son simply remarked: what’s the difference? That won him the argument. Thankfully, he wasn’t sent to the headmistress. But maybe there is something parents can do. If your child had decent early years that were not saturated with television, mobile phones and junk food, but instead played with Lego or dolls, read books, engaged in sports, built dens, climbed trees, bashed around on musical instruments and played imaginary games, they may be showing signs of courage now. If so, equip them with the arguments and material they need to fight back. To start with, familiarise them with Section 406 of the Education Act 1996. Entitled ‘Political Indoctrination’, it states: ‘The governing body and head teacher shall forbid (a) the pursuit of partisan political activities by any of those registered pupils at a maintained school who are junior pupils, and (b) the promotion of partisan political views, in the teaching of any subject in the school.’ Tragically, the rest is up to them. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 7, Summary: The article expresses outrage at the teaching of 'anti-racism' theories and identity politics in British schools, particularly focusing on the Church of England schools.

{"prompt":"Apart from the 96 arrests and 255 burned cars, Bastille Day passed off without a hitch in France. A bullish Interior Minister, Gerald Darmanin, expressed his satisfaction in a tweet, thanking the 45,000 policemen and women who had been deployed across the country. It says much for the state of France that avoiding a riot on their national day is a cause for celebration. Still, one can understand why the government is grateful for small mercies after the trauma of the recent uprising. The financial cost of the damage caused by the rioters is predicted to top €1 billion (£858 million), a staggering sum for a country that is already dangerously indebted. This figure is double that of the unrest of 2005, when for three weeks youths went on the rampage. The gravest cost to France of those riots 18 years ago, however, wasn’t financial but ideological, although it took several years before this became apparent. The date it did was March 2012 when 23-year-old Mohammed Merah murdered seven people over the course of eight days, including soldiers and Jewish children. Merah was the first of what Gilles Kepel – France’s leading expert on Islamic extremism – termed the ‘third generation’ of jihadists. The first generation fought in Afghanistan in the 1980s; the second came of age at the turn of the millennium, inspired by Al-Qaida, and the third generation appeared in 2012. The difference, Kepel explained in 2015, shortly after two more of this generation – the Kouachi brothers – had murdered the staff of Charlie Hebdo, was that they were not as highly trained and disciplined. ‘They are not professional terrorists,’ he said, which made them more susceptible to making mistakes. On the other hand, the fact they don’t belong to any organisation ‘allows them to slip under the radar of the police’. Kepel pinpoints three factors as central to the evolution of this third generation of jihadists in France, and all occurred in 2005: the first was the release online of ‘The Global Islamic Resistance Call’ by Abu Mus’ab Al-Suri, a 1600-page call to arms by an Islamist intellectual  that would become a guide to waging a jihadist’s guerrilla war in EuropeThe second factor was the launch of YouTube in 2005. The site would become a crucial platform in the diffusion of Islamist propaganda among a young generation of Muslims searching for an identity in 21st century Europe. And then there were the riots in France in the autumn of 2005. In his 2015 book, Terror: the genesis of the French Jihad, Keppel wrote that between 2005 and 2012 there was a major shift within Islam in France as a result of the riots. ‘The most significant consequence of the 2005 riots was the emergence of the generation of post-colonial immigrants,’ he explained. ‘Through the scenes of devastation, the looting, burning of vehicles and harassment of the police, it sent an existential message to the rest of the population.’ This message was the assertion of Islamic identity, a phenomenon some commentators now call the ‘re-Islamisation’ of French Muslims, specifically among the young. This was borne out in 2020 by a survey that reported 57 per cent of 15-24 year-olds believed Islamic law was more important than French law. Thus far a ‘fourth generation’ of jihadists has not materialised; but there is what Kepel terms an ‘atmospheric jihadism’, consisting of angry young men whose callow minds are exploited by older Islamists. Their strategy is the ‘creation of a culture of rupture with the Republic and its values’. The recent riots will accelerate this rupture, feeding into the narrative of an ‘Islamophobic’ French state that oppresses its Muslim population. It doesn’t help that the governments of Algeria and Turkey are encouraging this sense of victimisation. Recep Erdogan said the recent riots were a consequence of France’s ‘racism’ and ‘colonialism’. At the time of the 2005 riots in France, Erdogan – then prime minister of Turkey – blamed the disorder on the fact that, in 2004, France had banned the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in schools. The new riots come at a time when European intelligence services, including MI5, report that the Islamic State is again planning to attack the continent. London, Berlin and Paris are said to be on their hit list and ‘active commando units’ have reportedly already been infiltrated into Europe. That is just one facet of the threat. Arguably the greater danger – certainly to France – comes from the homegrown extremists, a new generation of Merahs, Kouachis, Coulibalys (who murdered four shoppers in a Jewish supermarket in 2015) and the Bataclan killers. They emerged from the smouldering aftermath of the 2005 riots when their youth, immaturity and aimlessness were manipulated online and in person (often in prison, where Merah, Coulibaly and Chérif Kouachi were radicalised post-riots) by veteran extremists. Last year in France, nearly 100 ‘Third Generation’ extremists were released from prison in France, most of whom were convicted for travelling to Syria to fight between 2013 and 2015. A similar number will be freed this year. According to the French counter-terrorism unit responsible for monitoring the inmates on their release from prison, the majority are no longer committed to violent jihad but ‘most remain sufficiently ideologically anchored’. If that is the case, and they wish to share their ideology and experience with a new generation, then they may find a receptive audience among some of the angry young men who recently ran riot in France. ->","completion":" Political Direction: Right, Magnitude of Bias: 6, Summary: The article discusses the recent Bastille Day celebrations in France and the aftermath of the riots that occurred during the event. The author emphasizes the financial cost of the riots and highlights the ideological impact of the 2005 riots in France, which led to the emergence of a 'third generation' of jihadists. The article links the riots to the rise of 're-Islamisation' among young French Muslims and suggests that the recent riots will further exacerbate the rupture between the French state and its Muslim population. The author also mentions the threat of Islamic extremism and the release of radicalized extremists from prison in France. The viewpoint leans towards the right, expressing concerns about the impact of Islamic extremism and criticizing the French government's handling of the situation.\n"}
