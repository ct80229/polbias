# polbias
Basic Tkinter app that uses a fine-tuned model of GPT-3 to determine the political bias of a given news article.
Bias is graded on a scale of 0-10, and is on a linear spectrum (left to right). 
This scale is relative to current American politics (and should therefore be slightly more right-leaning than most other countries).

Key: 
0: Neutral or unpolitical
1-3: Largely neutral; presents multiple perspectives but exhibits slight preferences
4-7: Political motive is evident; may acknowledge opposition, but usually in a negative light
8=10: Heavily favors a political ideology; misleading/inaccurate information is present
